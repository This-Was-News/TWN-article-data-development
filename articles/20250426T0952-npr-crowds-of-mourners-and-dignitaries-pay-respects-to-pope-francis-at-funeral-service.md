## Article summary
The funeral of Pope Francis took place in Rome, drawing tens of thousands of mourners and numerous world leaders to St. Peter's Square to honor the late pope. Following his death at 88 from heart failure and a stroke, the service celebrated his life and contributions to the Catholic Church and society. A public viewing allowed thousands to pay their respects before his coffin was sealed. The mass featured a procession led by a priest, with significant attendance from political leaders, including President Trump and former President Biden, alongside various senior clergy. The ceremony was a blend of traditional Catholic rites and Francis' personal wishes for a simpler service.

Pope Francis' body will be buried in the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, marking a departure from the tradition of interring popes within the Vatican. His tomb will bear the Latin name "Franciscus," reflecting his humble approach to leadership. The service emphasized his vision of the Church as a compassionate institution addressing societal issues. After the funeral, a period of mourning will commence, with public access to his tomb starting the following Sunday. The event underscored the profound impact Pope Francis had on global peace and interfaith relations, as expressed by attendees.
