## Article summary
President Trump met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican on April 26, 2025, just before attending Pope Francis' funeral. The White House described their discussion as "very productive," with plans to release more details later. This meeting follows a contentious previous encounter between the two leaders in February, which ended in disagreement over U.S. aid. Photos from the meeting showed them engaged in conversation, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who are involved in European peace efforts. Trump has been actively working to facilitate peace talks to resolve the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. He expressed optimism on social media, suggesting that most major issues had been addressed and that high-level negotiations should commence. However, Zelenskyy has pushed back against proposals that include ceding Crimea to Russia, citing constitutional concerns. Trump's frustration with Zelenskyyâ€™s stance has been evident, particularly regarding recent Russian attacks on Kyiv. The meeting signifies ongoing diplomatic efforts amidst a complex geopolitical landscape.
