## Article summary
Pope Francis has chosen to be buried in St. Mary Major basilica, marking a significant departure from tradition, as he will be the first pope in over a century not to be interred in the Vatican Grottoes. This decision, attributed to "divine intervention" by Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas, reflects Francis' deep connection to the Virgin Mary, who he believed requested his burial at the basilica. The church, renowned for its historical significance and beautiful architecture, has long been a place of prayer for the pope, who visited it 126 times during his papacy. 

Francisâ€™ tomb, a simple wooden casket lined with zinc, embodies his preference for humility and simplicity, aligning with his overall message of equality among people. The basilica, located in the Esquilino district of Rome, has a rich history and is home to the revered icon of Salus Populi Romani, which Francis often prayed before. 

His burial site is situated near the chapel of this icon, and the area has been bustling with visitors eager to pay their respects. The choice of St. Mary Major also reflects the basilica's historical role, as it has housed the remains of several popes over the centuries. Francis' burial will be a poignant reminder of his commitment to reaching out to marginalized communities and emphasizing the importance of simplicity and compassion in faith.
