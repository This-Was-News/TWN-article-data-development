## Article summary
Pope Francis, the first Jesuit and Latin American pontiff, passed away at the age of 88 due to a stroke and subsequent health complications. Elected in 2013 after Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, Francis aimed to transform the Catholic Church by promoting inclusivity and addressing issues such as migration, poverty, and environmental concerns. His papacy was marked by efforts to reform church leadership, tackle sexual abuse scandals, and improve relations with other faiths, though he faced opposition from conservatives within the church. Despite health challenges in his later years, he continued to advocate for marginalized communities and traveled extensively, focusing on peace and reconciliation in conflict areas. Francis's leadership style, characterized by humility and a preference for decentralization, reshaped the College of Cardinals and empowered local bishops. While he opened discussions on controversial topics, such as same-sex relationships and the role of women in the church, many hoped for more decisive changes that did not fully materialize. His legacy includes a commitment to the poor and a call for a church that engages with the world's pressing issues. Francis's death marks the end of a transformative era for the Catholic Church, leaving a profound impact on its future direction.
