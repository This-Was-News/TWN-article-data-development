## Article summary
**"Photos:** Pope Francisâ€™ Last Journey" details the final moments and funeral of Pope Francis, who passed away on April 21, 2025. Throughout his papacy, he traveled extensively, visiting numerous countries and advocating for modesty and inclusivity within the Church. His funeral, held at St. Peter's Basilica, was a significant event, attracting hundreds of thousands of mourners, including students and church groups. The ceremony was marked by a blend of humility and grandeur, as Francis had previously approved guidelines to simplify his funeral compared to those of his predecessors. 

The pope's body was transported in a customized popemobile, and dignitaries paid their respects before the service. The funeral included a procession where fourteen pallbearers carried the coffin, adorned with an open Gospel, as a choir sang psalms. In a departure from tradition, all clergy were allowed to participate in the ceremony, reflecting Francis's vision of a less hierarchical Church. Security was heightened in Rome, with thousands of police officers present as mourners gathered, some waiting all night to enter St. Peter's Square. Ultimately, Francis was laid to rest in a tomb at the papal basilica of St. Mary Major, marked simply with "Franciscus."
