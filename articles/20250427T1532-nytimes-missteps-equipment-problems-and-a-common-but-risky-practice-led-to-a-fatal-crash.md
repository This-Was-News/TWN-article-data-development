## Article summary
The article details the tragic crash of an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet at Reagan National Airport on January 29, 2025, which resulted in the deaths of all 64 people on board both aircraft. The incident was attributed to multiple missteps, including the helicopter crew's failure to effectively execute a common practice called visual separation, which allows pilots to navigate around other aircraft. Despite acknowledging nearby traffic, the Black Hawk crew did not alter their course in time, leading to a collision. Systemic issues in U.S. aviation, such as low staffing at air traffic control and reliance on outdated protocols, compounded the risks. The helicopter's transponder was turned off for security reasons, preventing real-time tracking by controllers. Investigators found that the controller did not provide clear instructions to the Black Hawk crew, which may have contributed to the crash. The article emphasizes the need for improved safety measures, including a ban on visual separation for helicopters in busy airspace. The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to release a final report on the crash by early 2026. In light of the incident, the FAA has already implemented restrictions on helicopter flights near the airport.
