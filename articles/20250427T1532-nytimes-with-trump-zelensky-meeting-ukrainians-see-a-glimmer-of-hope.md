## Article summary
President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has sparked a glimmer of hope among Ukrainians amid their ongoing struggle against Russia's invasion. After the meeting, Trump questioned why President Putin continues the war, suggesting that different approaches, including more sanctions, might be necessary. This interaction marked a significant shift from previous U.S. policy, with photos showing the two leaders engaged in a more equal dialogue compared to a prior disastrous meeting in the Oval Office. Ukrainians are cautiously optimistic that Trump may not push for a one-sided peace deal, as the U.S. has been advocating for a plan that compromises Ukraine's NATO aspirations. 

Zelensky emphasized the need for a full cease-fire and a reliable peace, while some Ukrainian officials expressed concern over the pressure to make concessions for peace. Despite Trump's assertion that Ukraine is losing the war, there are calls for stronger sanctions against Russia to achieve lasting peace. The meeting has also raised questions about the evolving relationship between Trump and Zelensky, with plans for future discussions uncertain. Overall, the encounter appears to have provided a momentary boost in morale for Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict.
