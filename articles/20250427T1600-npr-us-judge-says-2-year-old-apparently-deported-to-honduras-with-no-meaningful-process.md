## Article summary
A federal judge in Louisiana has stated that a 2-year-old American citizen, referred to as VML, was deported to Honduras without proper legal procedures. The judge, Terry Doughty, expressed concern that this occurred while he was attempting to clarify the child's status with the government. VML was deported alongside her mother and 11-year-old sister, despite the court's efforts to intervene. Doughty scheduled a hearing for May 16 to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deportation.

The deportation took place shortly after the family was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during a routine check-in. The father of the children was reportedly not informed of their deportation until shortly after it began, and he had minimal communication with his partner during the process. The Department of Homeland Security defended the action, claiming the parents wanted the child to be deported with them, although the father remained in the U.S.

This incident highlights ongoing criticisms of the Trump administration's expedited deportation policies and raises questions about due process rights for individuals facing deportation. VML's case is one of many that illustrate the complexities and potential injustices in the immigration system.
