## Article summary
The investigation into the January 29 collision at Ronald Reagan National Airport reveals that the crash, which resulted in fatalities for all on board the American Airlines regional jet, was caused by a complex interplay of errors rather than a single mistake. The Black Hawk helicopter crew failed to effectively execute the see-and-avoid practice, which requires pilots to visually detect and avoid nearby air traffic. The air traffic controller did not issue urgent warnings about the converging aircraft, missing critical opportunities to inform the Black Hawk crew of the jet's position. Additionally, technology issues hampered communication, with some instructions going unheard due to radio interference and the helicopter's tracking technology being turned off for security reasons. The route combination of the helicopter and the jet created a hazardous situation, particularly as the controller attempted a risky maneuver by sequencing landings on a less commonly used runway. The helicopter was flying higher than the maximum altitude allowed for its route, reducing the safety margin. In the final moments, the Black Hawk pilot ignored a directive from her co-pilot to change course, leading to the collision. Overall, the investigation highlights systemic failures in aviation safety protocols and communication that contributed to the tragedy.
