## Article summary
The article details the tragic crash of an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet at Reagan National Airport on January 29, 2025, which resulted in the loss of all lives on both aircraft. The incident was attributed to a combination of human error, equipment failures, and systemic deficiencies in U.S. aviation safety protocols. The Black Hawk crew attempted to utilize a common aviation practice called visual separation, which allows pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently, but they mishandled it. The helicopter was flying too high, and key radio communications were disrupted, preventing the crew from receiving crucial instructions. Additionally, the helicopter's tracking technology was turned off due to Army protocol, further complicating air traffic control's ability to monitor its movements. The air traffic controller, who was managing both helicopter and commercial jet traffic due to staffing shortages, failed to provide clear and urgent instructions to avert the impending collision. Investigations revealed that visual separation, while essential for traffic flow, poses significant risks and has been linked to numerous fatal incidents. Following the crash, the FAA imposed restrictions on helicopter flights in the area and limited the use of visual separation. The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to release a final report on the incident by early 2026.
