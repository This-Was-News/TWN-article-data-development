## Article summary
The article discusses the wave of lawsuits prompted by President Trump's tariffs, which have significantly impacted businesses like Learning Resources, led by CEO Rick Woldenberg. Facing high tariffs on imports, Woldenberg has joined others in legally challenging Trump's authority to impose these tariffs without Congressional approval. The lawsuits, filed by state officials and small businesses, argue that Trump's actions violate the constitutional order and overstep presidential powers. Notably, major business lobbying groups have refrained from joining the legal battles, opting instead for negotiations with the administration. The legal challenges center around the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump invoked to impose tariffs, a move unprecedented by previous presidents. Small business owners, such as Jamey Stegmaier from Stonemaier Games, express fears of retaliation from the administration while seeking relief from the financial burdens of tariffs. California's attorney general has also filed a lawsuit, emphasizing the need to check the president's authority. The article highlights the broader implications of these legal disputes, particularly regarding executive power and the potential economic consequences for the U.S. The ongoing litigation reflects a critical test of the balance between presidential authority and Congressional oversight in trade matters.
