## Article summary
The article discusses how federal employment has historically provided a pathway to the middle class for Black workers, but recent job cuts under the Trump administration are destabilizing this stability. Federal jobs have been crucial for many Black families, offering benefits and job security that are increasingly threatened by workforce reductions, hiring freezes, and the dismantling of diversity programs. The piece highlights individual stories, such as Shirley Hopkins, who dedicated her career to recruiting Black students for federal internships, and Calvin Stevens, who credits his federal job with enabling him to achieve middle-class status. 

Experts express concern that these job cuts disproportionately affect Black employees, as they constitute a significant portion of the federal workforce. The article emphasizes the historical context, noting that World War II opened doors for Black Americans in federal employment, which has served as a model for equity. As federal job attractiveness declines, younger generations may seek opportunities in the private sector, potentially limiting their career pathways. The article concludes with a warning about the potential long-term impacts on Black communities, particularly in areas such as Prince George's County, Maryland, which have benefited from federal employment. Overall, the cuts threaten not only individual livelihoods but also the broader stability of the Black middle class.
