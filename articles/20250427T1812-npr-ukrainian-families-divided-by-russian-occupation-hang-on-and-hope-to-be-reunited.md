## Article summary
The article highlights the struggles of Ukrainian families divided by Russian occupation, focusing on their hopes for reunion amid ongoing conflict. Many displaced individuals, like Kateryna Kyshkan, actively contribute to the war effort by volunteering to make camouflage netting for the Ukrainian army, despite having fled their homes in occupied territories. The article details the perilous journey they endure to escape, including navigating Russian checkpoints and the fear of repercussions for displaying Ukrainian symbols. 

Ukrainians in Zaporizhzhia express their longing for the safety of their loved ones still in occupied areas, such as Sergey Vasylko, who maintains daily contact with his grandparents while avoiding sensitive topics to protect them. The article also notes the grim realities of life under occupation, including lawlessness and violence, which forced many to leave their homes.
