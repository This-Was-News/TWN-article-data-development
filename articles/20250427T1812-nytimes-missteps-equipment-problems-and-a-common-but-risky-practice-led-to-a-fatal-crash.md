## Article summary
The article discusses the tragic midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet at Reagan National Airport on January 29, 2025, which resulted in the deaths of all 64 people on board both aircraft. The incident was attributed to a series of missteps, including the helicopter crew's failure to effectively execute visual separation, a common practice allowing pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently. The Black Hawk was flying at an unsafe altitude, and communication breakdowns between the crew and air traffic controllers contributed to the disaster. The air traffic controller was managing both helicopter and commercial traffic due to staffing issues, which heightened the risk. Investigators found that the helicopter's tracking technology was turned off, further complicating the controller's ability to monitor its movements. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting an investigation, with findings indicating systemic deficiencies in U.S. aviation safety. The FAA has since restricted visual separation maneuvers and helicopter flights in the area to prevent future incidents. The article emphasizes the need for improved safety protocols and communication in busy airspaces to avoid similar tragedies.
