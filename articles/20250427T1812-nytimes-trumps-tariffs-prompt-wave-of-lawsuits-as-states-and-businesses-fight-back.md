## Article summary
Trump's tariffs have sparked a surge of lawsuits from various opponents, including businesses and state officials, challenging his authority to impose such high import taxes. Among them is Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, who faces significant costs due to the tariffs on his shipments. These legal actions question the constitutionality of the tariffs and the extent of presidential power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump invoked to justify them. Several Democratic attorneys general have filed lawsuits, arguing the tariffs disrupt the economy and violate constitutional norms. Major business lobbying groups have refrained from legal action, opting instead to engage with the administration for tariff reductions. The lawsuits highlight the risks businesses face in opposing the administration, with some plaintiffs expressing fear of potential retaliation. Legal experts note that previous presidents have not used emergency powers for tariffs, setting a precedent that could influence the outcome of these cases. As the trade war continues, the implications of these legal challenges may significantly affect U.S. economic policy and executive authority. The situation remains fluid, with ongoing debates about the legality and economic impact of the tariffs.
