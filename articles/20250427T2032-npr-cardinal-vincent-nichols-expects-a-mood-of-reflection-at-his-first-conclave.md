## Article summary
Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, is preparing for his first papal conclave, expressing that the experience is "intimidating." He anticipates a "mood of reflection" among the cardinals as they gather to elect a new pope, moving away from the typical oppositional discussions. Nichols highlights the diversity within the College of Cardinals, noting that many were appointed by Pope Francis, and emphasizes the importance of listening to their varied experiences from around the world.

He acknowledges the need to address the painful issue of sexual abuse within the Church, mentioning his long-standing meetings with survivors and the necessity of involving outsiders for support. Nichols believes that being chosen as pope represents a significant sacrifice, equating it to a "mini kind of death," as the new leader will lose all privacy and personal life. 

During the conclave, cardinals will be sequestered and cut off from the outside world, which poses challenges for Nichols, who is concerned about missing updates on soccer scores and his prayer app. He has prepared for the conclave by packing extra socks, aware that the duration can vary significantly until a consensus is reached among the cardinals.
