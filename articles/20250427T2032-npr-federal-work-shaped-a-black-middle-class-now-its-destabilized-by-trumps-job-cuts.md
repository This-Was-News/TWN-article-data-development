## Article summary
The article discusses how federal employment has historically been a pathway to the middle class for Black workers, but recent job cuts under the Trump administration are destabilizing this stability. Black individuals make up a significant portion of the federal workforce, and the administration's workforce reductions, hiring freezes, and dismantling of diversity programs disproportionately affect them. Personal stories from former federal employees illustrate the importance of these jobs in providing stability, benefits, and opportunities for advancement. The cuts threaten not only individual livelihoods but also the broader Black middle class, particularly in areas like Prince George's County, Maryland, which has become one of the wealthiest majority-Black counties due to federal employment. Experts express concern that limiting federal job opportunities will hinder the ability of Black workers to transition into the private sector, further impacting their economic mobility. As federal job security diminishes, younger generations are reconsidering federal employment as a viable career path. The article highlights the fragility of the Black middle class and raises questions about the long-term implications of these cuts on Black families and communities.
