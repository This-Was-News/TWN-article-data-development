## Article summary
Ukrainian families are grappling with the emotional toll of being separated due to the ongoing Russian occupation, particularly in the province of Zaporizhzhia, where many have fled from their homes. Volunteers, including Kateryna Kyshkan, are actively participating in the war effort by weaving camouflage netting for the Ukrainian army, having escaped from occupied territories where they faced severe dangers, including intimidation and violence from Russian soldiers. The challenges of leaving occupied areas involve navigating Russian checkpoints and enduring a frightening "filtration" process.

The situation is compounded by the Kremlin's demands for recognition of occupied regions as part of Russia, a claim rejected by Ukraine and international bodies. Families like that of Alyona Serdyuk and Sergey Vasylko, who fled their hometown, are left with memories of a peaceful life disrupted by war, and they express deep concern over the potential recognition of occupied territories by foreign powers. Communication with relatives still in occupied areas is fraught with caution, as discussions about the war could endanger their safety.

Despite the grim circumstances, these families cling to hope for reunion, though the ongoing conflict makes that increasingly uncertain. The governor of Zaporizhzhia emphasizes that Ukraine will never accept the loss of its territories, asserting that any imposed ceasefire would only delay further conflict. As the war continues, the longing for home and the fear of losing loved ones remains a poignant aspect of their lives.
