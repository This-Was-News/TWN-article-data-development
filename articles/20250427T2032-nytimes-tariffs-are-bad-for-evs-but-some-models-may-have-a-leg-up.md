## Article summary
President Trump's tariffs on imported cars and auto parts could hinder the growth of electric vehicles (EVs), a vital technology for combating climate change. However, U.S.-made electric models like the Tesla Model Y and Volkswagen ID.4 may benefit due to having fewer imported parts, making them less susceptible to tariffs. The tariffs could increase battery and component costs, potentially harming domestic EV manufacturing and benefiting Chinese automakers. While efforts to establish a domestic supply chain for EVs are underway, many essential raw materials still come from China, which could face tariffs. Tesla's Model Y, made in California or Texas, topped Cars.comâ€™s American-made index, giving it a cost advantage over traditional vehicles. The Volkswagen ID.4, produced in Tennessee, also stands to gain from these tariffs, although the overall impact remains uncertain. Many automakers might prioritize more profitable gasoline vehicles over EVs due to the financial pressures of tariffs, risking competitiveness against international manufacturers. Additionally, tariffs on semiconductors and charging equipment could further slow EV adoption and infrastructure growth. The situation remains complex, with unpredictable ripple effects across the automotive industry.
