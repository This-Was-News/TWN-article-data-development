## Article summary
Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, is preparing for his first papal conclave, expressing an expectation of a reflective atmosphere among the cardinals. He acknowledges the weight of the task to elect a new pope, noting the shift from political speculation to a deeper contemplation of the Church's global diversity. Nichols emphasizes the importance of listening to the diverse experiences of cardinals from regions like Rwanda and Myanmar, highlighting the rich tapestry of stories that shape the Church. He also stresses the need for the Church to address the issue of sexual abuse, advocating for external help and support for survivors. Nichols reflects on the profound sacrifice involved in becoming pope, describing it as a "mini kind of death" that entails a complete loss of privacy. During the conclave, cardinals will be sequestered, cut off from outside communication, which poses challenges for Nichols, especially regarding his mobile phone. He humorously notes his concerns about missing soccer scores while preparing for a potentially lengthy conclave. Ultimately, Nichols views the conclave as an opportunity for introspection and unity among the cardinals as they navigate this critical moment for the Catholic Church.
