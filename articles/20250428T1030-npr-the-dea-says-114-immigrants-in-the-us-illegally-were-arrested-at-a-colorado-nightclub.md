## Article summary
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced that a raid at an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs resulted in the arrest of 114 immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. This operation, carried out in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, also led to the seizure of drugs and weapons. The arrests occurred early on a Sunday morning, with authorities stating that over 200 individuals were present in the club at the time. The DEA reported that those arrested were placed on buses for processing and potential deportation. Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated that the club had ties to gang activity, specifically referencing the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and MS-13. The raid is noted as one of the largest single-day arrests of undocumented individuals since the Trump administration's promise of mass deportations began. The DEA's Special Agent in Charge described the scene inside the club as involving significant drug trafficking and violence, with multiple firearms seized. Additionally, it was mentioned that several active duty service members were present at the nightclub either as patrons or security. The legal status of the arrested individuals and evidence of gang affiliations were not immediately verified.
