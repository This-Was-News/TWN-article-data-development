## Article summary
The article discusses the challenges President Trump faces in rallying Republican unity to pass his budget bill. Congress is set to begin the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to bypass the typical 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Despite Republican control of both chambers, internal divisions complicate consensus on key aspects of the multi-trillion dollar bill, which includes tax cuts, increased defense spending, and border security funding. Disagreements arise particularly over the scale of spending cuts, with House committees needing to find significant savings, while Senate expectations are much lower. A contentious issue is the proposed $880 billion cut to Medicaid, which faces opposition from several Republicans concerned about the impact on vulnerable populations. Speaker Mike Johnson aims to deliver the legislation to Trump's desk by Memorial Day, but time constraints and differing priorities may hinder progress. Additionally, there are concerns regarding budgetary gimmicks that could exacerbate deficits. Trump's involvement in negotiations, including direct appeals to lawmakers, could influence outcomes as the party navigates these challenges. Overall, the article highlights the complex interplay of fiscal policy, party unity, and political pressure within the GOP.
