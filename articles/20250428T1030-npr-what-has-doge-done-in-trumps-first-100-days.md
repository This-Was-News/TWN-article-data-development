## Article summary
In the first 100 days of President Trump's second term, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has not met its goals of delivering promised savings, efficiency, or transparency. Instead, it has gained significant power over government data while overseeing mass layoffs and the dismantling of various federal agencies. Initially a response to perceived waste, DOGE's objectives have shifted, with its savings target drastically reduced from $2 trillion to $150 billion due to legal challenges and public backlash. Despite claims of uncovering substantial waste, actual savings reported by DOGE are questionable and plagued with inaccuracies.

Elon Musk, who leads DOGE, has faced criticism as many initiatives have been delayed or reversed. The organization has also targeted spending that contradicts its mission, eliminating programs aimed at improving government efficiency. Federal employees report that the cuts appear arbitrary and lack strategic planning. Overall, while DOGE has reshaped the federal landscape, its effectiveness and integrity remain under scrutiny, with many questioning its true impact on government operations.
