## Article summary
Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have confirmed the deployment of North Korean troops in Russia's war against Ukraine, particularly in the Kursk region. Kim praised the bravery of these soldiers and announced the construction of a monument for those who died in combat, reinforcing the military alliance between the two nations. Putin expressed gratitude for the contributions of North Korean special forces, stating that their sacrifices would be honored alongside Russian soldiers. Reports indicate that up to 14,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, with approximately 4,000 casualties since their involvement began. The alliance is seen as a strategic move for both countries, as it enhances their negotiating positions in ongoing peace talks and provides North Korea with potential economic and military support from Russia. The situation has caused concerns among South Korean and U.S. officials regarding possible aid to North Korea in exchange for its military support. Analysts suggest that the collaboration may continue to deepen, with North Korea potentially sending more troops to bolster its influence. The conflict has also seen Ukraine contesting Russia's claims of territorial control, emphasizing its ongoing resistance.
