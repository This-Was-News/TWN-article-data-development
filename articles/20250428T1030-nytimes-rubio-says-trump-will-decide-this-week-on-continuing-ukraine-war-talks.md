## Article summary
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will decide this week whether to continue negotiations regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He emphasized the importance of determining the U.S. involvement in the talks while expressing cautious optimism about potential outcomes. Rubio's comments followed a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican, marking their first in-person encounter since a tense Oval Office meeting earlier this year. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mentioned that while Russia is open to a deal, specific elements still need to be refined. 

Contentious issues remain, including U.S. recognition of Crimea as Russian territory and Ukraine's NATO membership status under Trump. Following a recent meeting in Moscow, Trump suggested that both sides are close to a deal, urging high-level talks to finalize it. However, tensions arose when U.S. proposals were rejected by Zelensky's aides, leading to the cancellation of planned talks in London. Rubio reiterated that the U.S. must be prepared to move on if a compromise seems unattainable. The administration's decision this week will significantly impact the future of U.S. engagement in the conflict.
