## Article summary
The article discusses Ukraine's expanded drone program, known as the Line of Drones, which aims to sustain military operations amid concerns over U.S. support and ongoing peace talks. Ukrainian soldiers are primarily operating drones from basement hideouts, controlling them with remote equipment. This initiative is crucial as the country faces a potential decrease in military aid from the U.S. and seeks to innovate in its defense strategy. The program has already shown effectiveness, contributing to a slowdown of the Russian offensive, despite Russia having a numerical advantage in drones. Ukraine's drones are responsible for approximately 70% of casualties in the conflict, emphasizing their importance over traditional weaponry. The initiative also addresses recruitment challenges, as operating drones requires fewer personnel compared to infantry roles. The goal is to create a self-sustaining force capable of operating independently from U.S. support while complicating Russian military logistics. The program reflects Ukraine's adaptability and innovation in warfare, with the potential for broader applications in military strategy.
