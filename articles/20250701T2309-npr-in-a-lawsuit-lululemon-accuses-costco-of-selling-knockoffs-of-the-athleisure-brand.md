## Article summary
Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco, alleging that the wholesale retailer is selling knockoffs of its signature athleisure designs under the Kirkland Signature brand at lower prices. The lawsuit, filed on a Friday, claims that various companies have replicated Lululemon's proprietary apparel designs, which are referred to as "knockoffs" in the fashion industry. Lululemon highlights the impact of social media, mentioning the hashtag "LululemonDupes," which helps users find similar products at a reduced cost. The complaint accuses Costco of unlawfully leveraging Lululemon's reputation and goodwill by selling unauthorized apparel that infringes on the brand's design patents.

Lululemon emphasizes its commitment to protecting its intellectual property rights, stating that it invests significantly in product research, development, and design. The brand, founded in 1998 in Vancouver, has become a leading player in the fashionable athletic market, with revenues exceeding $10 billion last year. Meanwhile, Costco, known for its private label products, generated $254.5 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024. As of now, Costco has not responded to the lawsuit.
