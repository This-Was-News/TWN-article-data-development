## Article summary
RFK Jr. recently announced that the U.S. would cut over a billion dollars in funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, citing concerns over vaccine safety based on a 2017 study from Guinea-Bissau. The study claimed that children who received the DTP vaccine were more likely to die from various causes compared to those who did not receive it. However, experts question the validity of this study, noting that its data is over 40 years old and not reflective of current vaccine practices. Furthermore, two key researchers later published a paper that found no negative effects on all-cause mortality related to the DTP vaccine. Critics also highlight methodological issues in the 2017 study, including a lack of control for socioeconomic and health factors. Additionally, today's DTP vaccines are significantly different from those used in the study. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has consistently found no negative effects associated with the DTP vaccine over the years. Experts warn that RFK Jr.'s decision could have severe consequences for global health, potentially leading to increased mortality rates. Overall, the consensus among vaccine specialists is that the evidence presented by RFK Jr. does not convincingly support his claims against Gavi.
