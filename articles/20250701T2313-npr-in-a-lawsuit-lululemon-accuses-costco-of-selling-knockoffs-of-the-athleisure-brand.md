## Article summary
Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco, accusing the wholesale giant of selling knockoffs of its signature athletic apparel under the Kirkland Signature brand. The lawsuit claims that Costco is illegally trading on Lululemon's reputation and goodwill by offering unauthorized versions of its designs at lower prices. Lululemon highlighted the prevalence of the hashtag "LululemonDupes" on social media, which indicates a market for these imitations. The brand emphasizes its commitment to protecting its intellectual property rights, stating it invests significantly in product research and design. Founded in 1998 in Vancouver, Lululemon has become a leader in the athleisure market, with revenues exceeding $10 billion last year. Costco, known for its competitive pricing and private label products, generated $254.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024. The lawsuit underscores the challenges brands face with imitation products in the fashion industry. Costco has not yet responded to the allegations.
