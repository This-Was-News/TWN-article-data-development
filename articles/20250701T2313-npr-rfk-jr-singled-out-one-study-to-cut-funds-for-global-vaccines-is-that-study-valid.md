## Article summary
The announcement by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to cut over a billion dollars in U.S. funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, was based on a 2017 study that suggested the DTP vaccine might increase mortality rates among vaccinated children in Guinea-Bissau. However, vaccine experts have raised significant concerns regarding the validity of this study, noting that its data is over 40 years old and not reflective of current vaccine safety. Additionally, the authors of the study later published findings from more recent data that found no negative effects on all-cause mortality for children vaccinated with DTP. Critics also pointed out methodological flaws in the original study, including the lack of a randomized controlled trial and insufficient control for various socioeconomic factors.

Furthermore, the DTP vaccine used in the 1980s differs from modern formulations, which are considered safer and more effective. Experts reaffirmed that extensive evaluations have consistently shown no adverse effects linked to DTP vaccination, emphasizing the importance of vaccines in reducing child mortality. Kennedy's decision to pause funding could have severe implications for global health, potentially resulting in increased deaths, according to health specialists. Overall, the scientific community largely disputes the claims made by RFK Jr. and stresses the critical role of vaccines in public health.
