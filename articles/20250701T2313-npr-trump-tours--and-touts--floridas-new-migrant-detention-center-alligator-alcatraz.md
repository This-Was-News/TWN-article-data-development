## Article summary
President Trump recently toured a controversial migrant detention facility in Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. Accompanied by officials including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Trump praised the facility's setup, which is designed to hold up to 5,000 detainees in tents and trailers. The facility is expected to start receiving its first arrivals shortly after the tour, with a focus on expediting the deportation process. The site has drawn criticism from various groups, including environmentalists and Indigenous communities, who are concerned about its impact on the Everglades ecosystem and the cultural significance of the land. Protests have erupted against the facility, highlighting fears over detainee welfare and potential oversight issues. Despite the backlash, state officials assert that the facility will be temporary and are drafting disaster plans for its operation. Trump and DeSantis have urged other states to develop similar detention centers. The project is estimated to cost $450 million for the first year, with much of the funding expected to be reimbursed by FEMA. Overall, "Alligator Alcatraz" represents a significant step in the Trump administration's efforts to enhance immigration enforcement and detention capacity.
