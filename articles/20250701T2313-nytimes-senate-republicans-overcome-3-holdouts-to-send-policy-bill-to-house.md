## Article summary
The Senate has passed President Trump's significant policy bill, which aims to cut taxes and reduce social safety net programs, sending it to the House for further consideration. Trump has intensified attacks on Democratic New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, falsely claiming he is an illegal immigrant and threatening arrest if he obstructs immigration enforcement. The bill, which includes steep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, has faced criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, including Senator Lisa Murkowski, who reluctantly supported it after securing protections for Alaskans. Critics argue that the legislation disproportionately benefits the wealthy while harming low-income Americans, with an analysis predicting significant income losses for the poorest households. In addition to the domestic policy bill, Trump has nominated Alina Habba as New Jersey's U.S. attorney, despite her lack of prosecutorial experience. The bill's passage is crucial for Trump as it aligns with his legislative agenda, but it risks alienating voters concerned about healthcare access. House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are preparing to oppose the Senate version of the bill, which they view as detrimental to their constituents. The legislation also includes provisions that could lead to millions losing health insurance and food stamp benefits. Overall, the bill represents a significant shift in federal spending priorities, with potential long-term implications for the national debt and public services.
