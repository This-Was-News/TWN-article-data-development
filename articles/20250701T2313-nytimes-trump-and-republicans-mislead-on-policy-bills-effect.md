## Article summary
The article fact-checks claims made by President Trump and Republicans regarding a proposed tax and domestic policy bill. Trump asserted that failing to pass the bill would result in a 68 percent tax increase, which is false; estimates indicate a modest increase of about 7.5 to 12 percent, translating to an average increase of $1,900 to $2,800. He also claimed there would be no taxes on tips, Social Security, or overtime; however, the bill only offers temporary deductions for tips and overtime and limited tax reductions for Social Security benefits, which remain largely taxable for seniors. 

The Senate bill proposes an additional deduction of $6,000 for seniors, but this does not eliminate taxation on benefits. Furthermore, the claim that the bill represents the largest tax cut for middle-class Americans is inaccurate, as previous legislation provided larger tax cuts. Analysis shows the Senate bill would yield a 1.9 percent tax cut for the middle quintile, significantly less than past cuts. The article highlights that both the Senate and House bills may include provisions that could negatively impact the middle class. Overall, many of the assertions made by Trump were found to be exaggerated or misleading.
