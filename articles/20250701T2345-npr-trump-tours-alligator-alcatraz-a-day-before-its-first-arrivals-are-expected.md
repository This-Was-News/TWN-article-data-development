## Article summary
President Trump visited the newly established migrant detention center in Florida, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. The facility, designed to accommodate up to 5,000 beds, aims to expedite the removal of migrants, with first arrivals expected soon. During the tour, Trump praised the setup as a collaborative government effort and likened it to an East Coast version of Alcatraz. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis emphasized the facility's security, highlighting its remote location and natural barriers.

Despite its swift establishment, the project has faced significant opposition from environmentalists, Indigenous groups, and immigration advocates concerned about oversight and the facility's impact on the fragile Everglades ecosystem. Critics argue that the detention center could harm endangered species and disrupt local communities. Environmental groups have initiated legal action to halt the facility's development, claiming it bypassed necessary environmental reviews. DeSantis has dismissed these concerns, asserting the facility's temporary nature and minimal environmental impact. The project has garnered support from Florida Republicans, who are promoting "Alligator Alcatraz" merchandise.
