## Article summary
The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's policy bill aimed at slashing taxes and social safety net programs, with a 51-to-50 vote that included a tiebreaker from Vice President JD Vance. The legislation, which is crucial for Trump's domestic agenda, faces significant resistance in the House due to deep divisions among Republicans. Some senators, including Susan Collins and Thom Tillis, opposed the bill, citing concerns over its impact on Medicaid and the national debt. The bill proposes $3.8 trillion in tax cuts and increased funding for border security and military, but critics warn it could add $3.3 trillion to the national debt and result in millions losing health care coverage. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed intent to expedite a vote, but support remains uncertain, with some Republicans voicing strong opposition. The legislation also includes strict work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP recipients, which has sparked backlash from those representing vulnerable populations. Provisions were added to gain support from holdout senators, particularly for rural health care. The bill's passage is seen as a political gamble, with potential repercussions for Republicans in upcoming elections. Overall, the legislation is characterized by contentious negotiations and significant cuts to essential federal programs.
