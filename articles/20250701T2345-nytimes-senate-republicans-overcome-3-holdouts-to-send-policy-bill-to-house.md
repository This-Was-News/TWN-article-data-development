## Article summary
The Senate has passed a significant policy bill championed by President Trump, which now moves to the House amid growing opposition from Republicans. The White House announced a pause in weapon deliveries to Ukraine, signaling a potential shift in U.S. support. Trump also expressed hope for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas ahead of Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit. Concerns within the House GOP are escalating, with several members expressing dissatisfaction with changes made in the Senate version of the bill, particularly regarding cuts to Medicaid and increased national debt. Speaker Mike Johnson faces a challenging path to secure the billâ€™s passage, needing to manage dissent within his party. Trump has urged House Republicans to unite and pass the legislation by his July 4 deadline. Meanwhile, he has made controversial comments about Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, threatening arrest without evidence of wrongdoing. Trump has nominated Alina Habba as New Jersey's U.S. attorney, despite her lack of prosecutorial experience. The Senate's policy bill is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans while potentially stripping essential support from low-income families. This legislative effort has sparked significant debate about its long-term fiscal implications and potential impacts on health care and social safety net programs.
