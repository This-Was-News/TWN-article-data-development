## Article summary
A federal jury in Manhattan is deliberating in the criminal trial of Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, concerning charges of sex trafficking and related offenses. After approximately 12 hours of discussions, the jurors indicated they had reached agreements on two counts: sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution involving Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, and another woman referred to as "Jane." However, they remain deadlocked on a racketeering charge, which alleges Combs used his business empire to conceal criminal activities.

Combs appeared troubled upon receiving the jury's note, which mentioned "unpersuadable opinions" regarding the racketeering charge. Both the prosecution and defense presented proposals to the judge on how to proceed, with prosecutors suggesting a modified "Allen charge" to encourage deliberation, while Combs' attorney argued for the jury to continue without additional pressure. 

The federal prosecution is pursuing five criminal counts against Combs, with potential sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison. Judge Arun Subramanian instructed the jury to keep deliberating, emphasizing their duty to reach a decision. The jury concluded their discussions for the day and will resume on Wednesday.
