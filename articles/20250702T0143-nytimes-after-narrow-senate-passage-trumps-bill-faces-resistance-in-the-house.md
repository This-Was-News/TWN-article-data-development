## Article summary
The Senate narrowly passed a significant Republican bill aimed at slashing taxes and social safety net programs, with a 51-to-50 vote that required a tiebreaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. This legislation, part of President Trump's domestic agenda, faces resistance in the House due to deep divisions within the GOP, with some members vowing to block it. Key provisions include extending $3.8 trillion in tax cuts from Trump's first term and introducing new tax breaks, while also proposing substantial cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The bill's passage followed intense negotiations, particularly to secure support from holdouts like Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. However, several House Republicans expressed concerns about the deeper Medicaid cuts and the overall impact on the national debt, which could increase by at least $3.3 trillion over a decade. Additionally, the legislation imposes new work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP recipients and makes significant cuts to clean energy tax credits. Despite attempts to address concerns with added provisions for rural health care, dissent among Republicans remains strong. The House is expected to vote soon, but it is uncertain if Speaker Mike Johnson can maintain the necessary support. Democrats are poised to leverage the bill's unpopular aspects in upcoming elections.
