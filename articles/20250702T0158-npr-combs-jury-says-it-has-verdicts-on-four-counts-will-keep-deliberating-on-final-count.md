## Article summary
The jury in Sean Combs' sex trafficking trial has reached verdicts on four counts but is still deliberating on a racketeering charge. They informed Judge Arun Subramanian that they agreed on two charges: sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, linked to allegations involving Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman identified as "Jane." The prosecution claims Combs coerced these women into drug-fueled sexual activities with male sex workers. However, the jury has yet to reach a unanimous decision on the racketeering charge, which involves accusations that Combs used his business empire to conceal criminal activities, including bribery and drug distribution. Federal prosecutors are pursuing five total counts against Combs, with potential sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison. The racketeering charge carries the most severe consequences, with a maximum sentence of life. Judge Subramanian has instructed the jury to continue their deliberations on this charge. The jury concluded their discussions for the day and plans to resume on Wednesday.
