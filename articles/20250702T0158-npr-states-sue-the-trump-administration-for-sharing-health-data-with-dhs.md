## Article summary
Twenty states, led by California, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing sensitive Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement purposes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the administration's actions as a violation of privacy protections, claiming it fosters fear and discourages people from seeking essential medical care. The data shared included personal information about millions of Medicaid recipients from states like California, Illinois, and Washington, many of whom are low-income immigrants. The lawsuit seeks to prevent further data sharing and demands the destruction of any unlawfully disclosed information. DHS defended the data transfer as part of an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits. The Department of Health and Human Services maintains that the data sharing was legal and aims to combat misuse of federal funds. The lawsuit coincides with the Senate passing significant cuts to Medicaid and other federal programs. Critics have raised concerns about the administration's data aggregation efforts, which they argue violate privacy laws. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between state and federal authorities over immigration enforcement and healthcare access.
