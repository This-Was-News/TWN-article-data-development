## Article summary
The GOP megabill, which incorporates much of President Trump's domestic agenda, has passed the Senate with a narrow 51-50 vote and now faces a critical vote in the House. Key components include the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increased funding for border security, defense, and energy production. However, disagreements persist over funding methods, particularly regarding a higher debt limit increase and cuts to Medicaid, which could impact millions of Americans. The Senate version proposes significant tax incentives, such as increased child tax credits and expanded standard deductions, while also lifting the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. Reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and changes to Medicaid eligibility are contentious, with concerns about the potential loss of coverage for many. Both chambers agree on substantial funding for border security, but the Senate allocates less for hiring border agents compared to the House. Additionally, the Senate bill phases out clean energy tax incentives, raising alarms about increased electricity costs and reliance on foreign imports. As House Republicans prepare for a final vote, they must navigate these changes and address internal dissent to meet a self-imposed deadline.
