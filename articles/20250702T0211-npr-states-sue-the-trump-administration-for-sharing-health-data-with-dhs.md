## Article summary
Twenty states, led by California, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing sensitive Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement purposes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the administration for undermining privacy protections and creating a culture of fear that deters individuals from seeking necessary medical care. The data transfer, which involved millions of Medicaid recipients, was ordered by federal health officials and has raised concerns about confidentiality, as states are required to share personal information with the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS). The lawsuit seeks to prevent further data sharing and demands the destruction of any unlawfully disclosed information. DHS defended the data transfer as a legal measure to ensure that unauthorized immigrants are not receiving Medicaid benefits. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also stated that the data sharing was part of an effort to identify misuse of federal funds. The lawsuit coincides with significant cuts to Medicaid proposed in President Trump's domestic policy bill. Critics of the administration's data aggregation efforts have raised alarms over security and privacy violations. The other states joining the lawsuit include Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, and several others.
