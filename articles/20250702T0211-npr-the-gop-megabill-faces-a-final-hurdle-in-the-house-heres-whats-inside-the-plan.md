## Article summary
The GOP megabill, which incorporates significant elements of President Trump's domestic agenda, has passed the Senate and now faces a crucial vote in the House. The Senate's version includes key provisions such as extending Trump's tax cuts, increasing funding for border security, and making cuts to Medicaid. However, disagreements linger over funding methods, particularly regarding a higher debt ceiling increase and additional Medicaid cuts, which could lead to millions losing health coverage. Significant changes in tax incentives, such as modifications to the child tax credit and the standard deduction, have also been introduced. 

The bill aims to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with stricter work requirements and increased state costs. In terms of state and local tax deductions, the Senate plan temporarily raises the cap, which is crucial for some House Republicans from high-tax states. The legislation proposes a $5 trillion increase to the debt limit, essential to avoid a government default. Additionally, it outlines a new tax on clean energy, phasing out incentives that could hinder solar and wind project development. 

Despite these changes, both chambers agree on allocating billions for border security and overhauling student loan repayment options. The bill's fate hinges on securing enough support from House Republicans to meet a self-imposed deadline before heading to the president's desk.
