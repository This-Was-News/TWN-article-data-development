## Article summary
Sean Combs, the hip-hop mogul known as Diddy, was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of more serious charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The jury deliberated for over 13 hours before announcing their verdict, which led to mixed reactions in the courtroom. Prosecutors struggled to convince the jury that Combs' ex-girlfriends had not consented to the alleged activities, despite their testimony claiming manipulation. Combs did not testify, and his defense focused on text messages showing enthusiasm for the encounters, arguing that the relationships were toxic but did not meet federal criminal standards. The prosecution failed to prove that Combs ran a criminal conspiracy, which would have led to harsher penalties. The counts of transportation to engage in prostitution carry a maximum sentence of 10 years each. Following the verdict, Judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs bail before sentencing. Additionally, Combs faces numerous civil lawsuits, including a recent $20 million settlement with Ventura, where he did not admit wrongdoing. Combs is known for his significant influence in hip-hop and for founding Bad Boy Records.
