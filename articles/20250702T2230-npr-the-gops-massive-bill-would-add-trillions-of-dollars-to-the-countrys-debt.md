## Article summary
The GOP's recent tax cut and spending bill is projected to increase the federal debt by trillions over the next decade. Estimates vary, with the Yale Budget Lab predicting a $3 trillion increase, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimating $3.4 trillion, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggesting $4 trillion or more. Critics, including Maya MacGuineas, argue that passing the bill reflects a disregard for the nation's fiscal health, as it adds to the existing debt while extending tax cuts from the Trump administration and reducing government revenues. The bill also proposes increased spending on defense and immigration, alongside cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, which only partially offset its costs. Economic growth benefits from the bill are expected to be minimal, with previous analyses indicating modest gains overshadowed by higher interest payments. The tax cuts are likely to disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, leaving lower-income individuals worse off due to the loss of government benefits. Middle-income taxpayers may see modest savings, while the top 10% could gain significantly. Overall, the measure is criticized for prioritizing tax relief for the wealthy at the expense of fiscal responsibility.
