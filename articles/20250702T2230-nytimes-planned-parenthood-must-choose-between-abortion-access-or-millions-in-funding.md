## Article summary
The recent passage of a spending bill by Senate Republicans could strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding, significantly jeopardizing abortion access even in states where it remains legal. The bill imposes a one-year ban on Medicaid payments to any nonprofit offering abortions that received over $800,000 in federal funds in 2023, potentially affecting nearly 200 Planned Parenthood health centers. While federal law already prohibits Medicaid dollars from funding abortions, this legislation threatens the financial support for other essential services provided by these clinics. Planned Parenthood, which serves over two million patients, faces a critical funding crisis, especially in blue states like California and Illinois, where many clinics could close. The organization has vowed to continue providing abortions, but the decision ultimately rests with individual affiliates regarding their operational viability without federal support. Some affiliates, like Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, are grappling with the impact of maintaining abortion services versus losing crucial revenue from Medicaid. Despite concerns, Planned Parenthood's national leadership insists there is no plan to cease abortion services to preserve funding. The Mar Monte affiliate has estimated it would require significant philanthropic support to avert a public health crisis if the bill is enacted. Overall, the situation presents a challenging dilemma for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates amidst ongoing political pressures.
