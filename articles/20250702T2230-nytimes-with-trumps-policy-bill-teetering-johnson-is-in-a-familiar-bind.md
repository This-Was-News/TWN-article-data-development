## Article summary
Speaker Mike Johnson is currently facing challenges in advancing President Trump's policy bill, relying on Trump's influence to rally support within a divided Republican party. Despite his inexperience and skepticism from some party members, Johnson has previously succeeded in navigating similar obstacles, often utilizing Trump's charisma to win over dissenting lawmakers. On a recent occasion, Johnson met with both hard-line conservatives and moderates to address concerns about Medicaid cuts and the national debt increase associated with the bill. Trump's personal engagement has proven effective, as seen in past legislative victories where he managed to sway critical votes. 

Johnson's current situation marks a significant test, as he cannot promise amendments to the bill without risking its demise in the Senate. He has attempted to reassure lawmakers by suggesting future reconciliation efforts and emphasizing the need for fiscal responsibility. The ongoing negotiations highlight the precarious nature of the legislative process, with potential mini-revolts always looming. Ultimately, Johnson's ability to maintain party unity and navigate these complexities will determine the fate of the sweeping policy package.
