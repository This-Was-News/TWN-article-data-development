## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed an unusual lawsuit against the entire federal district court in Maryland, targeting all 15 judges over a policy related to immigration cases. The dispute began when the chief judge in Maryland ordered a 48-hour pause in cases involving habeas corpus petitions by migrants facing deportation, which the DOJ argues is an overreach. Retired Judge Andre Davis criticized the lawsuit as an attack on judicial independence, while the DOJ claims it is addressing judicial overreach. The case stems from the Trump administration's priority on immigration enforcement and follows a Supreme Court ruling that limited courts' ability to impose universal injunctions. Legal experts suggest the case could eventually reach the Supreme Court, highlighting broader tensions between the executive and judicial branches.
