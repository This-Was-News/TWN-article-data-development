## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to proceed with his executive order mandating mass layoffs of federal employees, lifting a lower court's temporary block. The unsigned order noted that the court did not express any view on the legality of the layoff plans and left open the possibility of future review. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the court was prematurely allowing the administration to proceed without legal scrutiny. The administration's plan aims to reduce the federal workforce significantly, citing government inefficiency, while opponents argue it bypasses congressional approval and could disrupt critical services. The American Federation of Government Employees and other groups vowed to continue their legal fight against the layoffs, maintaining that the plan violates constitutional procedures.
