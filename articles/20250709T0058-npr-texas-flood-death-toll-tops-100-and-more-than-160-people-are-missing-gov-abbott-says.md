## Article summary
The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas has risen to 109, with 161 people still missing in Kerr County. Rescue and recovery efforts continue in the hard-hit Texas Hill Country, though the chances of finding survivors are slim. The Guadalupe River surged over 26 feet in less than an hour, devastating areas like Camp Mystic, where 27 campers and counselors were lost. Questions have been raised about whether local officials could have done more to warn or evacuate residents, with some reporting they received no or late warnings. Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a special legislative session to address the needs of affected communities, while President Trump plans to visit the state.
