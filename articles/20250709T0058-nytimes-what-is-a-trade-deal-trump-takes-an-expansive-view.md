## Article summary
The Trump administration is pursuing global trade deals, but the definition of a trade deal has broadened under President Trump. Traditional trade deals are lengthy and complex, but the administration now refers to limited agreements, frameworks, and even unilateral tariff announcements as deals. The president has used the term "deal" loosely, including for agreements like the China truce and the Vietnam handshake deal, which lack detailed public descriptions. The administration's aggressive timeline for securing deals with numerous countries has been criticized as unrealistic by trade experts. Despite the uncertainty and limited scope of these deals, President Trump has continued to announce agreements, such as the U.S.-U.K. deal, before finalizing all details.
