## Article summary
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed an unusual lawsuit against the entire federal district court in Maryland, targeting all 15 judges over a policy on immigration cases. The dispute began when the chief judge in Maryland ordered a 48-hour pause in cases involving habeas corpus petitions by migrants facing deportation. The DOJ argues that the court's order undermines the executive branch, while critics see it as an attack on judicial independence. The case has been moved out of Maryland to avoid conflicts of interest, with a Trump-appointed judge from Virginia overseeing it. Retired judges and legal experts predict the case could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, highlighting broader tensions between the judicial and executive branches.
