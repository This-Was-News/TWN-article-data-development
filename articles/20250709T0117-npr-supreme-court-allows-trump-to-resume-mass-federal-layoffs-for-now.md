## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to proceed with mass federal layoffs, lifting a lower court's block on his executive order. The order was unsigned, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting and Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurring. The court did not rule on the legality of the layoffs, leaving that for future consideration. Trump's plan aims to reduce the federal workforce significantly, with agencies required to submit layoff plans. Critics argue the layoffs could disrupt critical government services and that Trump overstepped his authority by bypassing Congress.
