## Article summary
The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas has risen to more than 100, with over 160 people still missing, according to Governor Greg Abbott. Rescue and recovery efforts continue in the Texas Hill Country, with responders facing challenging terrain due to debris. Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp along the Guadalupe River, lost at least 27 campers and counselors, with six still unaccounted for. Questions have been raised about the adequacy of warnings and evacuations in Kerr County, known as "Flash Flood Alley." A special session of the Texas legislature will be held to address the needs of affected communities, and President Trump plans to visit Texas on Friday.
