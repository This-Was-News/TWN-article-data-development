## Article summary
The Trump administration is pursuing trade deals globally, with a broad interpretation of what constitutes a trade deal. Traditional trade deals are lengthy and complex, but the administration is using the term for limited arrangements, such as the framework deal with Britain and a handshake agreement with Vietnam. The president has also referred to a trade truce with China and unilateral tariff announcements as deals. The administration's approach has been criticized as unrealistic, with trade experts highlighting the complexity and time required for comprehensive agreements. The U.S. is pushing countries to open markets and address discriminatory taxes, but the rushed timeline and lack of detailed agreements have raised concerns about economic uncertainty.
