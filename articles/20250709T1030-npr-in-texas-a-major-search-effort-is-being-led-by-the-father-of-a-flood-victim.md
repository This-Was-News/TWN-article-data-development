## Article summary
In Texas, Thad Heartfield, an attorney whose son and three friends were swept away by flash floods on July 4, leads a volunteer search effort for victims along the Guadalupe River. Heartfield's son, Aidan, and Ella Cahill remain missing, along with over 160 others, with at least 109 confirmed fatalities. Volunteers, including relatives and friends of the missing, search through debris and dense areas, recovering bodies for their loved ones, with nine victims found by Tuesday. Heartfield organizes the search into one-mile zones, coordinating with law enforcement and first responders, and maintains a methodical approach despite his personal loss. The search continues along seven miles of the river, with no end in sight, as volunteers and officials work to identify and recover the missing.
