## Article summary
The Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to proceed with mass federal layoffs, lifting a lower court's temporary block. The unsigned order did not rule on the legality of the layoffs, leaving that for future consideration. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing the court was prematurely allowing the administration to proceed. Trump's plan aims to reduce the federal workforce significantly, with agencies required to submit layoff plans. The administration contends the president has the authority to conduct these layoffs without congressional approval, while opponents argue it oversteps executive power.
