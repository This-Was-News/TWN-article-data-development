## Article summary
Texas is currently relying on FEMA for disaster relief following devastating floods in Central Texas, with Governor Greg Abbott praising President Trump for quickly approving a major disaster declaration. However, President Trump has proposed eliminating FEMA, arguing that states should take on more responsibility for disaster response. Texas leaders, including Governor Abbott and the state's top emergency official, are part of a council considering changes to FEMA, with some suggesting states should handle more disaster-related tasks. Proposed changes include reducing federal disaster funding, simplifying the distribution of disaster-related money, and shrinking FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program. While some members of Congress propose reforms to improve FEMA's efficiency and focus on disaster preparedness, the president's goal of eliminating the agency in its current form requires congressional approval.
