## Article summary
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve, aligning with President Trump's demands for lower interest rates, despite the traditional independence of the Fed. Bessent has publicly criticized the Fed's handling of tariffs and interest rates, suggesting political motivations behind their economic projections. His comments could complicate his potential nomination as Fed chair, as he would need to balance Trump's expectations with the support of the Federal Open Market Committee. Bessent has also been involved in political controversies, drawing criticism from former Treasury secretaries like Lawrence H. Summers. The debate over Fed leadership highlights the tension between political influence and the central bank's independence, with significant implications for U.S. economic policy and debt management.
