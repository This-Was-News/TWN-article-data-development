## Article summary
In Texas, a major search effort is being led by Thad Heartfield, the father of a flood victim. Heartfield organizes volunteers to search for victims of the July 4 flood in Kerr County, where at least 87 people died and over 160 are missing. His son, Aidan Heartfield, and three friends were swept away by the floodwaters, and two of the friends have since been recovered. Heartfield divides volunteers into search zones to meticulously comb through debris along the Guadalupe River. Despite his personal loss, Heartfield remains composed and focused on recovering victims, coordinating efforts with law enforcement and other responders.
