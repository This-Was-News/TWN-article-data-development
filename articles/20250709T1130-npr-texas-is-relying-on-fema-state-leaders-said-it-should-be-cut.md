## Article summary
After devastating floods in Central Texas, Governor Greg Abbott praised President Trump for quickly approving a major disaster declaration, which unlocked federal funds for response efforts. However, President Trump has proposed eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), arguing that states should take on more responsibility for disaster response. Texas leaders, including Governor Abbott and the state's top emergency official, are part of a council considering changes to FEMA, with some suggesting states should handle more disaster-related tasks. Proposed changes include reducing federal disaster funding, simplifying the distribution of funds, and shrinking FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program. Meanwhile, members of Congress have proposed alternative reforms to improve FEMA's disaster preparedness and make funding more accessible, highlighting the agency's crucial role in responding to large-scale disasters.
