## Article summary
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve, aligning with President Trump's demands for lower interest rates, despite the traditional independence of the Fed. Bessent has publicly criticized the Fed's handling of tariffs and interest rate policies, suggesting political motivations behind their economic projections. His comments could complicate his potential nomination as Fed chair, as he would need to balance Trump's expectations with the support of the Federal Open Market Committee, which he has openly criticized. Bessent's political involvement, including mocking Elon Musk and disputing economic analyses, has drawn attention and criticism from former Treasury officials. Other contenders for the Fed chair position, such as Kevin M. Warsh and Kevin A. Hassett, have also been critical of the Fed's policies, with Trump favoring Bessent over current chair Jerome Powell.
