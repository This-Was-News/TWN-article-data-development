## Article summary
The article discusses the rise of masked federal immigration agents conducting arrests across the U.S., sparking fear and confusion. These agents, including ICE and other federal officers, often wear plainclothes and unmarked vehicles, obscuring their identities. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claims this is for the agents' safety, but civil rights groups argue it undermines public trust and creates terror in communities. Job Garcia, a Latino man, was detained for over 24 hours after recording and confronting masked agents who arrested a Latino driver at a Home Depot. Garcia is now suing DHS, alleging racial profiling and unlawful arrest, while DHS denies these claims and asserts Garcia assaulted an officer. The article also highlights concerns about the potential for violence and abuse due to masked arrests, as well as scattered reports of impersonators exploiting the situation. Democratic senators have introduced legislation to ban masks during immigration arrests, and Garcia expresses ongoing fear and a sense of otherness in his community.
