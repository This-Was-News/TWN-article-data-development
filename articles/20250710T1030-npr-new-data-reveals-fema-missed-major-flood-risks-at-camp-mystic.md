## Article summary
New data analysis from NPR, PBS's FRONTLINE, and data scientists reveals that FEMA's flood maps underestimated the flood risk at Camp Mystic, the site of a tragic flood in Texas. The analysis shows that more structures, including cabins for young campers, were at risk than FEMA had previously indicated. FEMA's maps have historically failed to account for rainfall and flash flooding, relying instead on coastal storm surges and large river flooding data. Nationwide, First Street found more than twice as many Americans live in dangerous flood-prone areas than FEMA's maps suggest. FEMA's outdated maps and lack of funding have led to inadequate preparation and insurance coverage for many homeowners, as seen in recent disasters like Hurricane Helene. Special interests and political factors have further delayed updates to flood maps and regulations. The Camp Mystic incident highlights the dangers of building in floodways, areas designated by FEMA as the most hazardous during floods. Despite known risks and stricter building rules, enforcement and preparation remain insufficient, with officials often underestimating the severity of flood threats. Experts emphasize the need for better decision-making based on available science to prevent future disasters.
