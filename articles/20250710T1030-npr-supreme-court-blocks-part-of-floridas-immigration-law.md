## Article summary
The Supreme Court upheld a lower court's decision to block part of a Florida law that criminalized undocumented immigrants crossing into the state, imposing mandatory prison terms. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis in February, faced immediate controversy after a U.S. citizen was wrongfully arrested under its provisions. Immigrant rights groups sued, arguing the law conflicted with federal immigration law, a claim supported by Supreme Court precedent. Florida defended the law as necessary to address immigration issues, though the Supreme Court has historically prioritized federal law in such conflicts. Despite the Supreme Court's action, DeSantis continues to emphasize immigration enforcement, recently leading a large-scale operation arresting over 1,000 undocumented immigrants.
