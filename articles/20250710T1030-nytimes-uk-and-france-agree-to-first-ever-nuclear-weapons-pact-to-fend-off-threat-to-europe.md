## Article summary
Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France are set to announce a new defense agreement on Thursday, which includes a joint commitment to deploy their nuclear arsenals in response to serious threats to Europe. This pact aims to strengthen European security amidst concerns about reduced U.S. support under President Trump and ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine. The leaders will also discuss a migration agreement to address the increasing number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, a contentious issue for both nations. The defense and migration agreements are part of efforts to mend diplomatic relations strained by Brexit. Additionally, the two leaders will join a call with other coalition countries to bolster support for Ukraine against Russia.
