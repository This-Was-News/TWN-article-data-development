## Article summary
The document discusses the rise of masked and unmarked immigration raids by federal agents, including ICE, across the U.S. These agents, often in plainclothes and unmarked vehicles, have been criticized for creating fear and undermining public trust. Job Garcia, a Latino man, was detained for over 24 hours after filming an arrest at a Home Depot, alleging he was targeted for speaking up and that the agents were profiling Latinos. The DHS defends the use of masks for agent safety, while civil rights groups and legal advocates argue it encourages violence and abuse. Garcia is suing DHS, and legislation has been introduced to ban federal immigration agents from wearing masks during arrests.
