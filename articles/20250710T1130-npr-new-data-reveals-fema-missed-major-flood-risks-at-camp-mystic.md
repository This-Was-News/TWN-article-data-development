## Article summary
New data analysis by NPR, PBS's FRONTLINE, and data scientists reveals that more structures at Camp Mystic, the site of a tragic flood in Texas, were at risk than previously reported by FEMA. Maps from First Street, a climate risk modeling company, show at least 17 structures in the flood's path, compared to FEMA's maps, which underestimate flood risks nationwide. FEMA's maps have historically overlooked rainfall and flash flooding, leaving many homeowners and officials unaware of dangers, as seen in Hurricane Helene's impact on North Carolina. Political and financial interests have hindered updates to flood maps and regulations, with developers lobbying for less regulation to keep housing affordable. Despite FEMA's designations of high-risk flood areas, warnings are often ignored, and outdated maps have led to significant underestimations of flood risks, as evidenced by the situation along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County.
