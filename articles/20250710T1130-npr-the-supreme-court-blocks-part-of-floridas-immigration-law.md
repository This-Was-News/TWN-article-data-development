## Article summary
The Supreme Court recently upheld a lower court's decision to block part of a Florida law that criminalized undocumented immigrants entering the state. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, imposed mandatory prison terms for violations. The court's brief order did not include any dissenting opinions or explanations. The law faced legal challenges from immigrant rights groups, who argued it conflicted with federal immigration law. Florida defended the law as necessary to address immigration issues, but the Supreme Court has historically prioritized federal law in such conflicts. The ruling follows similar legal challenges in other states like Oklahoma, Iowa, and Idaho, where courts also blocked state laws criminalizing illegal immigration. Despite the setback, DeSantis has continued to emphasize immigration enforcement, recently leading a large-scale operation that arrested over 1,000 undocumented immigrants.
