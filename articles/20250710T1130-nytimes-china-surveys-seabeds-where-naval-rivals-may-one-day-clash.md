## Article summary
China is expanding its ocean exploration efforts, driven by President Xi Jinping's ambition to establish the country as a maritime power with a leading navy and deep-sea capabilities. Chinese research vessels are venturing farther and deeper, collecting data that could enhance understanding of marine life and climate change, while also potentially aiding naval strategies, such as submarine deployment and tracking. The rapid growth of China's research fleet could provide Beijing with a significant advantage in maritime competition with the United States. Chinese ships have been studying strategically important waters, including areas off Taiwan's east coast and near Guam. The expansion of China's ocean research efforts is seen as a strategic move to lead in the deep seabed domain.
