## Article summary
Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France are set to announce a historic nuclear weapons pact, pledging to coordinate their nuclear arsenals in response to serious threats to European allies. This agreement, to be revealed during Macron's state visit to Britain, underscores their commitment to defending Ukraine against Russian aggression. While not a full nuclear protection guarantee, experts view it as a step toward enhanced European security, especially amid calls from the U.S. for Europe to bolster its own defenses. The leaders will also address migration, aiming to reduce cross-Channel asylum seekers, a contentious issue exacerbated by Brexit, which severed Britain's access to key European migration agreements. The pact and migration talks reflect efforts to mend diplomatic ties strained by Brexit, as both leaders emphasize cooperation to uphold international order and multilateralism.
