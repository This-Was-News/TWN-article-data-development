## Article summary
A federal judge in Concord, New Hampshire, blocked President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship nationwide. Judge Joseph Laplante granted a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of three non-citizen parents. The ruling applies to babies born to undocumented immigrants and people in the U.S. with temporary status, as Laplante granted class action status to the plaintiffs. Laplante described the government's arguments as unpersuasive and noted that denying children citizenship posed a threat of irreparable harm. The ruling follows a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting the scope of nationwide injunctions, but leaving the door open to class action lawsuits.
