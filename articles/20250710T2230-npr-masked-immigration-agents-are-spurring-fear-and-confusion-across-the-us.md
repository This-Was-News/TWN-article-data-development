## Article summary
Masked immigration agents are spurring fear and confusion across the U.S. The arrests follow a pattern: masked agents, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers assigned to work with ICE, wearing plainclothes and sometimes arriving in unmarked vehicles. Job Garcia, a 37-year-old photographer and Ph.D. student, witnessed an arrest at a Home Depot in Hollywood, Calif., where agents wore vests that read "POLICE U.S. BORDER PATROL" and their faces were covered. Garcia was detained for more than 24 hours and is now suing DHS, alleging he was targeted for speaking up and seeking $1 million in recompense. Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have introduced legislation that would ban federal immigration agents from wearing masks during arrests.
