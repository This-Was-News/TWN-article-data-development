## Article summary
The search for over 160 missing people after the Texas floods could take weeks or months, according to retired Army Lieutenant Gen. Russel L. Honor√©. The challenging conditions include extreme heat, debris, and the impact of rushing water, which can carry victims miles away. Search efforts are slowed by the need to carefully remove debris and the use of technology like cadaver dogs. Governor Greg Abbott has committed to continuing the search until all missing persons are found. The process involves documenting and identifying remains, sometimes using DNA, similar to efforts after Hurricane Katrina.
