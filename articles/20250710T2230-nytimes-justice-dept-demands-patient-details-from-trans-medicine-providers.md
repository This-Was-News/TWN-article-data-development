## Article summary
The Justice Department has subpoenaed over 20 healthcare providers treating transgender minors, seeking confidential patient information, as part of the Trump administration's efforts to limit transgender medical care. Critics argue this action is politically motivated and intended to intimidate providers, while officials claim it is a fact-finding mission to determine if any laws have been broken. The subpoenas are part of a broader coordinated effort between the Justice Department and the White House to curtail pediatric gender care, with other agencies like the F.B.I. and F.T.C. also applying pressure. Several hospitals, including those in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, have shut down their youth gender clinics due to mounting pressure and threats of funding cuts from the Trump administration. The debate over gender treatments for minors is contentious, with some clinicians and families advocating for the benefits, while critics argue for banning the treatments due to potential risks and uncertain evidence.
