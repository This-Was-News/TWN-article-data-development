## Article summary
Nvidia has become the first public company to reach a $4 trillion valuation, driven by its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The company's rapid rise is attributed to its early bet on graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI, which paid off with the release of ChatGPT and the subsequent AI frenzy. Nvidia controls over 80% of the market for AI chips, with major tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon investing heavily in its products. The company's market value surged from $330 billion in late 2022 to $4 trillion, with CEO Jensen Huang becoming one of the world's richest men. However, Nvidia faces challenges, including competition from tech giants developing in-house AI chips, regulatory scrutiny, and geopolitical risks, which could impact its long-term dominance.
