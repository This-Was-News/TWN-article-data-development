## Article summary
Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva has warned of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose a 50% tax on Brazilian imports. Lula emphasized that Brazil must be respected and will take necessary measures to protect its people and companies. Trump's threat, posted on social media, was in response to the trial of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro, whom Trump called a "Highly Respected Leader." Lula disputed Trump's claim that the trade relationship is "far from reciprocal," noting that the U.S. currently runs a trade surplus with Brazil. Experts suggest that using tariffs to influence another country's judicial proceedings is highly provocative and could escalate tensions differently than with other trade partners.
