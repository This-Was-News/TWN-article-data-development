## Article summary
Kerrville, Texas, a city of 25,000, became a hub for search and recovery efforts after devastating floods on July 4, 2025. While much of the city was bustling with volunteers and residents helping with recovery, some areas were severely damaged, with dozens of houses destroyed and at least five bodies found near the Guadalupe River. The city's water plant was significantly damaged, forcing residents to rely on well water for weeks. Despite the devastation, the community showed resilience, with locals and volunteers working together to clear debris and search for missing persons. The floods also claimed the lives of the Tivy High School boys soccer coach, his wife, and left their two young children missing, highlighting the profound impact of the disaster on the tight-knit community.
