## Article summary
The article discusses the potential life-saving benefits of flood warning sirens in Texas following the deadly July 4, 2025, flash floods that killed at least 120 people. Texas officials, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, are considering installing these sirens along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, with public support evident through a petition gathering nearly 40,000 signatures. Emergency experts emphasize that while sirens are effective for alerting people outdoors, they should be part of a broader warning system that includes cell phone alerts, social media, and TV/radio broadcasts. The article highlights past considerations and challenges, such as resident opposition to false alarms and the need for reliable river gauges to trigger sirens accurately. It also notes the importance of public education to ensure people understand the meaning of the sirens and the global use of such systems in countries like Switzerland and Germany, despite their limitations.
