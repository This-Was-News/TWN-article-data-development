## Article summary
Threats against local school officials in the U.S. have nearly tripled since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to research from Princeton University. The study found a 170% increase in harassment and threats from November 2020 to April 2021, compared to the same period two years later. The threats are not partisan and target officials with various political views, often fueled by disputes over cultural issues like diversity, equity, inclusion, and LGBTQ+ policies. School board members have also faced misinformation and fake controversies, making their jobs increasingly difficult. Despite the challenges, some officials, like Sarah Leonardi, continue their service, believing they are making a difference.
