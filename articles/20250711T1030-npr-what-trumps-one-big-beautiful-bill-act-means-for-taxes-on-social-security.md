## Article summary
President Trump's recently passed megabill introduces a new tax deduction for individuals aged 65 and older, aiming to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for many beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration sent an email celebrating the bill, but experts argue it was misleading, as the law doesn't create a special exemption for Social Security benefits but rather increases the standard deduction for seniors. The new $6,000 annual deduction primarily benefits middle- and upper-middle-class seniors, with those earning between $80,000 and $130,000 seeing the most significant tax cuts. Lower-income seniors won't see any change, as they already earn too little to pay taxes, while higher-income individuals won't qualify for the deduction. However, the tax cuts may accelerate the insolvency of Social Security and Medicare trust funds, potentially leading to benefit cuts unless Congress intervenes before the estimated insolvency date of late 2032.
