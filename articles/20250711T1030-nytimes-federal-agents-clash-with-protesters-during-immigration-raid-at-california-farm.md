## Article summary
Federal agents raided a large cannabis farm in Southern California, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple arrests. The operation, which involved executing criminal search warrants, was part of a series of immigration raids that have sparked demonstrations and panic in Latino communities. Ten juveniles, eight of them unaccompanied, were found at one of the facilities and were in the country illegally. The raids targeted multiple facilities owned by Glass House Farms, including locations in Camarillo and Carpinteria. The operation was criticized by Governor Gavin Newsom and Representative Salud Carbajal, who cited a lack of transparency.
