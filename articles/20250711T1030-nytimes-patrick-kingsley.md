## Article summary
The document details how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prolonged the war in Gaza to maintain his political power, despite opportunities for cease-fires and peace deals. Netanyahu faced pressure from far-right coalition members who opposed withdrawing from Gaza, fearing it would collapse his government and lead to early elections he was likely to lose. The war's continuation allowed Netanyahu to consolidate power, avoid accountability for corruption charges, and secure political survival through strategic alliances and military actions. The document highlights Netanyahu's decisions to expand the war into Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, which, while strengthening Israeli security, also prolonged the conflict and increased civilian casualties. Ultimately, Netanyahu's actions prolonged the war for personal political gain, despite the high human and strategic costs, and his legacy is now intertwined with the devastating impact of the prolonged conflict.
