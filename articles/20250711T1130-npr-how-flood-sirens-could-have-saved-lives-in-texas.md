## Article summary
Texas officials are considering installing flood warning sirens along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County following deadly flash floods on July 4, 2025, which killed at least 120 people. While sirens can alert people outdoors, experts emphasize the need for a comprehensive warning system that includes cell phone alerts, social media, and radio broadcasts. Kerr County previously considered sirens in 2016 but faced opposition due to concerns about false alarms. Effective siren systems require public education so people know what to do when they hear the alarms. Other countries, like Switzerland and Germany, use flood warning sirens, but their effectiveness depends on reliable monitoring and public awareness.
