## Article summary
Threats against local school officials in the U.S. have nearly tripled since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to research from Princeton University. The study found a 170% increase in harassment and threats from November 2022 through April 2023 compared to the same period two years earlier. The threats stem from various issues, including mask mandates, diversity initiatives, and LGBTQ+ policies, and affect officials across the political spectrum. School board members have also faced misinformation and false stories on social media, which fuel harassment and make their jobs more challenging. Despite the threats, some officials, like Sarah Leonardi, continue their service, believing they are making a difference.
