## Article summary
President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" introduces a new tax deduction for individuals aged 65 and older, aiming to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for some beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration sent an email applauding the legislation, but experts argue it was misleading, as the law does not exempt Social Security benefits from taxation but instead increases the standard deduction for seniors. The new $6,000 annual deduction primarily benefits middle- and upper-middle-class seniors, with those earning between $80,000 and $130,000 seeing the most significant tax cuts. Lower-income seniors already pay no taxes on their benefits, while higher-income individuals do not qualify for the deduction. The tax cuts, however, may accelerate the insolvency of Social Security and Medicare trust funds, potentially leading to a 24% reduction in benefits by late 2032 unless Congress intervenes.
