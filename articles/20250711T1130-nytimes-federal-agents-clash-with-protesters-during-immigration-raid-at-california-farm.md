## Article summary
Federal agents conducted a raid on a large cannabis farm in Southern California, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple arrests. The operation, which involved executing criminal search warrants, was met with demonstrations and panic in Latino communities. Ten juveniles, eight of them unaccompanied, were found at one of the facilities and were determined to be in the country illegally. The raids were part of a series of immigration enforcement actions that have sparked legal challenges and calls for focused enforcement on immigrants with criminal backgrounds. The operation was criticized by California officials, who cited a lack of transparency and questioned the involvement of multiple federal agencies and potential National Guard assistance.
