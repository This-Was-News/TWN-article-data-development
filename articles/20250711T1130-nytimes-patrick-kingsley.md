## Article summary
The article examines how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prolonged the war in Gaza to maintain his political power. It details how Netanyahu's decisions, driven by the need to keep his fragile coalition intact, delayed cease-fire negotiations and expanded military objectives. The war, which has caused extensive devastation and loss of life, has been prolonged despite opportunities for truce and peace deals, including a potential agreement with Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu's actions have been criticized for prioritizing his political survival over ending the conflict, leading to international condemnation and domestic unrest. The article also highlights Netanyahu's strategic maneuvers to deflect blame and consolidate power, including efforts to undermine his political opponents and manipulate public opinion.
