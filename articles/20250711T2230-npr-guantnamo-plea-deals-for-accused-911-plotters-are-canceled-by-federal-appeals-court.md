## Article summary
A federal appeals court has canceled plea deals for three men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The court ruled that then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had the legal authority to rescind the deals, which he did shortly after they were announced. The defendants' lawyers are considering whether to appeal the decision to the full federal bench or the U.S. Supreme Court. The case has been stalled for over two decades due to legal complexities, including the torture of the accused men in secret CIA prisons. Family members of 9/11 victims are divided, with some supporting plea deals to end the prolonged legal process and others insisting on a trial for justice and truth.
