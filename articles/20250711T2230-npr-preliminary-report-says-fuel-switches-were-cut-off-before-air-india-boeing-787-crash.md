## Article summary
A preliminary report from India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau indicates that fuel switches controlling the engines of Air India Flight 171 were set to "cutoff" just three seconds after takeoff, leading to a crash that killed 260 people. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was properly configured and took off normally, but the fuel switches were inexplicably turned off, causing the plane to lose thrust and altitude. Investigators found no evidence of mechanical failures or bird strikes, focusing instead on the pilots' actions. The first officer was piloting the aircraft, and cockpit recordings reveal confusion about who turned off the fuel switches. The crash, which occurred on June 14, 2025, was the first hull loss of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with only one passenger surviving.
