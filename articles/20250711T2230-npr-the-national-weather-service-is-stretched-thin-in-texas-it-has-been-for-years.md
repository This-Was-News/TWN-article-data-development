## Article summary
The document discusses the impact of staffing issues on the National Weather Service (NWS) in Texas, particularly after recent catastrophic flooding. Retired NWS meteorologists highlight long-standing staffing shortages, exacerbated by recent cuts and hiring freezes, which have led to brain drain and potential burnout among remaining staff. They note that while local offices performed well during the floods, the loss of senior staff and high vacancy rates could hinder future responses to extreme weather events. The document also mentions that federal funding priorities may be misaligned with the increasing frequency and severity of storms due to climate change. There are early signs of potential funding restoration for staffing, as the importance of the NWS is underscored by recent disasters.
