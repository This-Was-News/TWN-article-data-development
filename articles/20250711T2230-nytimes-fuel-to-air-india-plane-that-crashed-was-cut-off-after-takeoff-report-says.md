## Article summary
The preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash indicates that the fuel supply to both engines was cut off seconds after takeoff, with no evidence of mechanical failure or design flaws. The cockpit voice recording reveals a discussion between pilots about the fuel cutoff, but the cause remains unclear. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed about 30 seconds after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard and over 270 people on the ground. Investigators are examining the fuel control switches, which have safeguards to prevent accidental activation, and the pilots' actions. The crash has raised questions about Air India's safety and modernization efforts, with the final investigation expected to take months or years.
