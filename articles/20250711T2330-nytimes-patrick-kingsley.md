## Article summary
The document examines how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prolonged the war in Gaza for political survival, despite opportunities for cease-fires and peace deals. It details Netanyahu's decisions to avoid truce agreements, influenced by his fragile coalition with far-right ministers who opposed withdrawal from Gaza. The war's extension allowed Netanyahu to maintain power, avoid accountability for corruption charges, and secure political victories, including a strike on Iran. The document highlights Netanyahu's manipulation of domestic and international politics, his deflection of blame for the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, and his efforts to undermine institutions investigating him. Ultimately, the war's prolongation has resulted in significant civilian casualties and international condemnation, while Netanyahu has managed to extend his political tenure and legacy.
