## Article summary
Iosif Prigozhin, a Russian music producer, and his wife, pop star Valeriya, reside in Dubai, which has become a refuge for Russian elites due to its non-participation in Western sanctions. Prigozhin, known for his extensive contacts and celebrity status, shared insights into the Russian elite's perspective on the Ukraine invasion, revealing their initial disbelief and subsequent adaptation. The couple's close ties to President Vladimir Putin, including private gatherings, are highlighted, with Prigozhin describing Putin as charming and sentimental. Despite their proximity to power, they moved their assets to Dubai after facing financial repercussions from Western sanctions. Prigozhin's controversial phone call, allegedly criticizing Putin, led to social and professional backlash, but he maintains his loyalty to Putin, attributing the call to AI manipulation and a mix-up with another individual.
