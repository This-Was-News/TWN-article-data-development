## Article summary
A federal judge in Los Angeles has ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration raids in Southern California, citing evidence of racial profiling and violations of the Fourth Amendment. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued temporary restraining orders requiring reasonable suspicion for arrests and immediate access to lawyers for those detained. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleged widespread racial profiling by ICE and Border Patrol agents targeting Latino individuals. The judge's ruling restricts the administration's ability to conduct raids that have caused fear in immigrant communities since early June. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, while civil rights lawyers celebrated it as a victory against unconstitutional practices.
