## Article summary
A preliminary report from India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau reveals that fuel switches controlling the engines were set to "cutoff" moments before the crash of Air India Flight 171, which killed 260 people. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner had taken off normally from Ahmedabad, but three seconds later, the fuel switches were turned off, causing the plane to lose thrust and altitude. The report indicates that the switches were briefly returned to the "run" position, but only one engine managed to relight and generate thrust. Investigators are focusing on the pilots' actions, with no evidence of mechanical failures or bird strikes. The crash, the first hull loss of a Boeing 787, resulted in 241 fatalities on board and 19 on the ground, with only one survivor.
