## Article summary
Jacque White, a mother of five, returned to her flood-damaged cabin in Kerr County, Texas, a week after evacuating her children just before the Fourth of July floods. The floods, among the deadliest in Central Texas, killed over 120 people, including many children. Ms. White's cabin was severely damaged, with furniture and clothes lost, and a strong mold smell present. She plans to stay with friends and family until she can find a permanent home or repair the cabin. Volunteers provided meals, toys, and support to the family, and Ms. White expressed gratitude for their help and the resilience of her children.
