## Article summary
Iga Świątek of Poland dominated the Wimbledon women's final, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in under an hour. This was only the second time in the Open era that a Wimbledon title was won with a double bagel. Świątek, 24, became Poland's first singles champion at the tournament, receiving the trophy from Kate, the Princess of Wales. Anisimova, 23, was the first U.S. woman to reach the Wimbledon final since Serena Williams in 2019, marking a significant comeback after a hiatus due to burnout and mental health struggles. Despite the loss, Świątek praised Anisimova's performance and expressed hope for future matchups.
