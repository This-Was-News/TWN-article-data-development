## Article summary
Camp Mystic, established in 1926, has faced numerous floods due to its location near the Guadalupe River in Texas. The first major flood in 1932 caused significant damage, leading to discussions about the camp's future, but it reopened after repairs. Over the years, floods in 1951, 1978, 1987, 1988, and 2025 caused evacuations, structural damage, and fatalities, with the 2025 flood resulting in 27 deaths. Despite efforts to mitigate risks, such as rebuilding cabins and installing river gauges, the camp continued to face severe flooding. The 2025 flood was particularly devastating, claiming lives, including that of camp owner Dick Eastland, and highlighting the ongoing danger of the camp's location.
