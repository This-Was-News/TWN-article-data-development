## Article summary
A federal judge in Los Angeles has ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration raids in Southern California, citing evidence of racial profiling and unconstitutional arrests. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued temporary restraining orders requiring immigration agents to have reasonable suspicion before making arrests and to provide immediate access to lawyers for those detained. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other civil rights groups, alleged widespread racial profiling, with agents targeting individuals based on race, accents, or their work. The judge's ruling is a significant setback for the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has led to thousands of arrests and widespread fear in immigrant communities. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, while civil rights lawyers hailed it as a victory for the rule of law.
