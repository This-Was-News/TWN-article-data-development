## Article summary
New data from NPR, PBS's FRONTLINE, and data scientists reveals that FEMA's flood maps underestimated the flood risk at Camp Mystic, where over two dozen people died in a Texas flood. The analysis shows that at least 17 structures were in the path of floodwaters, with four cabins in an extreme flood hazard area. FEMA's maps have historically overlooked rainfall and flash flooding, leaving many Americans unaware of their flood risk. Recent disasters, like Hurricane Helene, have affected properties outside FEMA's designated floodplains, leaving homeowners without insurance or adequate protection. FEMA faces political and funding challenges in updating its maps, while special interests lobby for less regulation.
