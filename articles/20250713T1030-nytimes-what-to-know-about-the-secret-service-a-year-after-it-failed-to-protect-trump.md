## Article summary
One year after a failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the Secret Service faces scrutiny for its role in the incident. The agency has been criticized for systemic issues, including poor communication, inadequate planning, and staffing problems. Investigations revealed that the shooter, Thomas Crooks, evaded law enforcement due to uncoordinated efforts and basic human errors. The Secret Service has implemented some changes, such as assigning a top agent to oversee security operations, but challenges remain, including sharing threat information. The agency's new director, Sean M. Curran, aims to improve recruitment and preparedness, but concerns about its ability to prevent future attacks persist.
