## Article summary
Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp along the Guadalupe River, had multiple buildings removed from FEMA's flood maps despite evidence suggesting high flood risk. The camp requested these removals at least twice, with the last request coinciding with a major expansion in 2020. FEMA's maps, which do not account for rainfall or flash flooding, underestimated the flood risk compared to private data from First Street. The camp's buildings were situated in hazardous flood zones, and at least 17 structures were in the path of floodwaters during the July 4 flash floods that resulted in multiple fatalities. The discrepancy between FEMA's maps and private sector data highlights a nationwide issue where many Americans may be unaware of their flood risk.
