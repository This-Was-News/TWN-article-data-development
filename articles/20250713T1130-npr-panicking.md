## Article summary
Recent college graduates, like Azraiel Raines, are facing significant challenges in the job market, with many struggling to find employment. Despite an overall unemployment rate of 4.1%, employers are cautious about hiring due to economic uncertainty and policy changes. Many graduates are settling for lower-paying jobs or positions that do not align with their initial career goals. Economists note that the labor market for recent graduates is among the most challenging in the last decade, excluding the pandemic period. However, experts advise that initial job setbacks should not be seen as permanent, as many graduates find more rewarding positions within a few years.
