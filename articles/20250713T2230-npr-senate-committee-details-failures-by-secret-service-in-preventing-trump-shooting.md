## Article summary
A Senate committee report released Sunday detailed a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service that led to the assassination attempt against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump during a rally in Butler, Pa., last summer. The report, released by Sen. Rand Paul, highlighted communication breakdowns within the Secret Service and among other law enforcement agencies, which prevented timely action. Key failures included the delayed dissemination of information about a suspicious individual and an obstructed view for one of the Secret Service's countersniper teams. The report also revealed that the Secret Service had denied some resources to Trump's detail during the 2024 presidential election and that former Director Kimberly Cheatle had falsely testified to Congress. In response, the Secret Service has implemented 21 of 46 recommended reforms and disciplined six employees, though no one has been fired.
