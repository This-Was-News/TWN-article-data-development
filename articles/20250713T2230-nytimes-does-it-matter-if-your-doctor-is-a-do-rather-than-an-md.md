## Article summary
The number of doctors of osteopathic medicine (D.O.s) has grown significantly in the last decade, with over a quarter of all medical students in the United States training to become D.O.s. Despite this growth, many patients are unaware of the differences between D.O.s and M.D.s, with some even mistaking D.O.s for other types of practitioners. Historically, D.O.s were distinct from M.D.s in their philosophy and practices, but today the differences are minimal, with both attending similar residency programs and achieving comparable patient outcomes. D.O.s are more likely to work in rural areas and in primary care, a trend that some attribute to the osteopathic philosophy of serving neglected communities. The future of osteopathic medicine is uncertain, as the profession grapples with its distinctiveness and the possibility of being absorbed into traditional medical degrees.
