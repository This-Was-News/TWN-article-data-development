## Article summary
Federal regulators allowed Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, to remove multiple buildings from government flood maps despite evidence suggesting high flood risk. The camp requested FEMA to remove over a dozen buildings from floodplain designations multiple times, including during a major expansion in 2020. Removing structures from these maps can eliminate federal requirements for flood-resistant construction and insurance. An analysis by NPR and PBS's FRONTLINE revealed that many camp buildings were at higher flood risk than indicated by FEMA's maps, with at least 17 structures in flood waters during the July 4 flash floods that killed several campers and staff. FEMA's maps do not account for rainfall or flash flooding, relying instead on coastal and river flooding data, which may underestimate risks exacerbated by climate change. The issue is nationwide, with many Americans living in flood-prone areas not fully recognized by FEMA's maps. Despite FEMA's warnings, some camp buildings were located in the most hazardous flood zones, highlighting the potential consequences of ignoring flood risks.
