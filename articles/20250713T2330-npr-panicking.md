## Article summary
Recent college graduates are facing significant challenges in the job market, with many struggling to secure employment. Azraiel Raines, a graduate with a degree in global studies, had to settle for a job at her alma mater after her initial plans to work for the State Department fell through. Economists note that the labor market for recent graduates is among the most challenging in the last decade, with fewer opportunities due to cautious hiring practices by employers. Many graduates are accepting lower-paying jobs than they anticipated, as competition is fierce and employers are hiring more cautiously. Despite these challenges, experts advise graduates to be flexible and view their first jobs as stepping stones to more rewarding positions in the future.
