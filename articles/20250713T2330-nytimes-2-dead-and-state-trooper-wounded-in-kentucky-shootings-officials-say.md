## Article summary
A shooting in Kentucky on Sunday left two women dead and four others injured, including a state trooper, with the incident ending at the Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington. The shooter, who may have had ties to the church, was killed by police officers at the scene. The trooper was shot after pulling over a vehicle near the Blue Grass Airport and pursuing the suspect, who then carjacked another vehicle and fled to the church. The church is described as a close-knit community where many attendees are related or long-time friends. Governor Andy Beshear expressed his condolences and urged Kentucky residents to support the affected families.
