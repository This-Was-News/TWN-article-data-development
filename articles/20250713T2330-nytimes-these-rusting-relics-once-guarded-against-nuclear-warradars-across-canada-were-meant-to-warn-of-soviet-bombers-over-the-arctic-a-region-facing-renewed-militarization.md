## Article summary
In Canada's northern outposts, remnants of Cold War-era radar systems like the Pinetree Line and the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line stand as rusting relics. These systems, including the one in Chibougamau, Quebec, were crucial for detecting Soviet bombers and reflected Cold War fears of Arctic vulnerability. Today, the Arctic faces renewed militarization due to geopolitical tensions, with proposals like the $175 billion Golden Dome defense shield. Canada is considering its role in this new era, balancing increased military spending with maintaining independence from the United States. The legacy of these Cold War projects is evident in communities like Chibougamau, where the radar station once drove local life and economy.
