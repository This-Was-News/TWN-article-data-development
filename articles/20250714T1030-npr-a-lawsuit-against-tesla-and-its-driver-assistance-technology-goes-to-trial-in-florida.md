## Article summary
A lawsuit against Tesla and its driver-assistance technology is set for trial in Florida, stemming from a 2019 crash where a Tesla Model S, with Autopilot engaged, struck a parked SUV, killing a 22-year-old woman and injuring another. The plaintiffs allege that Tesla's marketing exaggerated Autopilot's capabilities, leading drivers to over-rely on the system, while Tesla maintains its technology is safe when used correctly. Federal regulators have investigated Tesla's driver-assistance systems, and the case is one of few to proceed to trial, as Tesla often settles such claims out of court. Tesla denies allegations of withholding crash data and argues that its systems enhance safety when used properly. The trial, expected to last three weeks, follows Tesla's assertion that the driver acknowledged responsibility for the crash.
