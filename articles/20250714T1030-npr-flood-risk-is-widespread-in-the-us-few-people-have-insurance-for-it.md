## Article summary
Despite widespread flood risks across the U.S., only 4% of homeowners have flood insurance. Most homeowners insurance policies do not cover flooding, and federal aid often only covers a fraction of repair costs after disasters. Recent floods in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina highlight the growing risk of intense rainfall due to climate change. Federal flood insurance, available through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, offers coverage up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for non-residential buildings, but costs are rising and can be unaffordable for many. While flood insurance protects property owners and communities, many people still roll the dice, hoping floods won't happen, and often face significant financial burdens when they do.
