## Article summary
The article explores the shifting definition of conservatism within the Republican Party, particularly in the context of loyalty to former President Donald Trump. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a conservative lawmaker, faced backlash from his party after opposing Trump's signature legislation, which would cut social programs like Medicaid. Tillis defended his record, highlighting his conservative achievements, but his stance led to threats of a primary challenge. The article notes that Trump's influence has redefined conservatism, making alignment with his policies a key factor in determining a lawmaker's ideological label. This shift has made it challenging for Republicans to maintain moderate positions, even in swing states, as deviation from Trumpism can be politically costly.
