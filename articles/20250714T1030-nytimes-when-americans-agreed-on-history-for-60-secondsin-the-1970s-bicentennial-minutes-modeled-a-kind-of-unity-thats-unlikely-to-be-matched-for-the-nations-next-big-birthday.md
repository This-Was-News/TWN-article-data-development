## Article summary
The web page discusses the Bicentennial Minutes, a 60-second CBS series from 1974 to 1976 that celebrated the American Revolution's bicentennial. Celebrities, artists, and politicians narrated historical events, concluding each segment with "That's the way it was." Despite initial criticism, the series won an Emmy and became a cultural phenomenon, even being parodied on shows like The Carol Burnett Show and Saturday Night Live. The author reflects on how this shared, nonpartisan experience feels alien today, given the current political divisions and the fragmentation of mass culture. The upcoming Semiquincentennial celebrations are unlikely to replicate the unifying spirit of the Bicentennial Minutes, with political polarization and the shift from broadcast TV to streaming and social media altering the cultural landscape.
