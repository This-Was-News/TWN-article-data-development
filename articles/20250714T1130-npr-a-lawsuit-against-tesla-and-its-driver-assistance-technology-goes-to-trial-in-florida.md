## Article summary
A lawsuit against Tesla and its driver-assistance technology is going to trial in Florida, stemming from a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured another person. The crash involved a Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged, driven by George McGee, who admitted to looking down at his phone before the collision. The plaintiffs argue that Tesla's marketing exaggerated Autopilot's capabilities, encouraging over-reliance on the system, while Tesla maintains its technology is safe when used correctly. Federal regulators have investigated Tesla's driver-assistance systems, and the company has faced criticism for withholding data related to the crash. The trial, set to last three weeks, is one of the few cases against Tesla that has proceeded to court, with the company often settling claims out of court.
