## Article summary
Despite widespread flood risks across the U.S., only 4% of homeowners have flood insurance, leaving many vulnerable to financial losses. Most homeowners insurance policies do not cover flooding, and federal aid often only covers a fraction of repair costs after disasters. Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, leading to more inland flooding. Federal flood insurance, offered through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, provides up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for non-residential buildings, but costs are rising and can be unaffordable for many. While flood insurance protects property owners and communities, many people still underestimate their risk and opt not to purchase coverage, especially in areas where it is not mandatory.
