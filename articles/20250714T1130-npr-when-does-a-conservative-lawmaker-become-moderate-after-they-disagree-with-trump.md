## Article summary
The article discusses the shifting definition of conservatism within the Republican Party, particularly in the context of loyalty to former President Trump. It highlights the case of Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who is considered a moderate by some due to his opposition to Trump's signature legislation, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Tillis' stance on Medicaid provisions in the bill led to criticism from his party, with some labeling him a "Republican In Name Only" (RINO). The article explores how Trump's influence has redefined conservatism, making alignment with his policies a key factor in determining a lawmaker's ideological standing. It also notes that political polarization has intensified, with the GOP moving significantly to the right, and that deviation from party loyalty can be a liability even in swing states.
