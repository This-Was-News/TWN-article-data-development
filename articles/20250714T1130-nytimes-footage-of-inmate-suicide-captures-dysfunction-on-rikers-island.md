## Article summary
The article highlights the dysfunction within the Rikers Island jail system, exemplified by the suicide of inmate Michael Nieves, who bled to death while awaiting medical assistance. Nieves, who had schizophrenia, had a history of self-harm and had been on suicide watch prior to his death. The New York Times obtained footage of Nieves' death and other incidents through a freedom of information request and subsequent lawsuit, revealing systemic issues within the jail. In 2022, 19 detainees died by suicide, overdose, or medical emergencies, with most deemed preventable. Despite decades of mismanagement and calls for reform, city officials resisted a federal takeover until a judge ordered it in May 2025, citing the jail's severe dysfunction.
