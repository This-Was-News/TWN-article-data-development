## Article summary
The article discusses the Bicentennial Minutes, a CBS series from 1974 to 1976 that aired 60-second segments about the American Revolution during prime time. Celebrities, artists, and politicians narrated historical events, concluding with the phrase "That's the way it was." The series was a form of civic education, sponsored by Shell Oil and later other companies, and won an Emmy in 1976. It was a product of its time, reflecting a shared cultural experience that transcended political divisions. The article contrasts this unified approach with today's polarized climate, where historical celebrations often become culture-war battlegrounds, and speculates on the possibility of recreating such a unifying moment for the upcoming Semiquincentennial.
