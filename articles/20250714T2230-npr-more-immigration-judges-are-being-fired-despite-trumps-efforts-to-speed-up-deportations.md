## Article summary
In July, 15 more immigration judges were fired, adding to the growing list of personnel cut by President Trump to expedite deportations. The judges, at the end of their two-year probationary period, were not given reasons for their terminations. These firings occurred despite Congress approving funding to hire more judges to address a backlog of nearly 4 million cases. The union representing the judges criticized the terminations, stating they hinder the enforcement of immigration laws. Additionally, EOIR leadership has encouraged judges to streamline asylum reviews and give oral decisions on case dismissals, while Trump has supported a plan to deputize state National Guard members as immigration judges.
