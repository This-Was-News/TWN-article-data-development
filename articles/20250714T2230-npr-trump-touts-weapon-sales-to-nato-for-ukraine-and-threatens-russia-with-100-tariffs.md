## Article summary
President Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on countries trading with Russia if a ceasefire deal with Ukraine isn't reached by September, while promising Ukraine billions in military equipment, including Patriot air defense systems. Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for his continued war in Ukraine, marking a shift from his earlier approach of leveraging a personal relationship to negotiate peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed optimism about strengthening Ukraine's air defense and joint production of weapons with Europe. Russian officials responded by calling the weapons deals a continuation of former President Joe Biden's policies and criticized the U.S. military-industrial complex. Despite the threats, Russia's main market index rose, and some Russian nationalists saw the 50-day deadline as an opportunity for a battlefield victory.
