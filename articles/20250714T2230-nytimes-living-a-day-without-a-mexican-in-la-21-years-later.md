## Article summary
The article reflects on the impact of federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, which have led many Latinos to stay home, creating a scene reminiscent of the 2004 indie film "A Day Without a Mexican." The film, created by Yareli Arizmendi and Sergio Arau, depicts a chaotic California where Mexicans suddenly disappear, highlighting their vital role in the state's economy and society. The political climate of the 1990s, marked by Proposition 187, inspired the film, which initially gained traction but faced criticism and backlash. Despite the progress made by Latinos in California, including increased political representation, recent immigration raids have brought the film's themes back into focus. Arizmendi and Arau have written a sequel script addressing current anti-immigration sentiments, but it has not gained traction with studios.
