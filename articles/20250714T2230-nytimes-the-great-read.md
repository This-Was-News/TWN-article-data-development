## Article summary
Dr. Purva Merchant, a pediatric dentist in Seattle, accidentally became the tooth fairy after creating an email address with that nickname. She started responding to parents' and children's emails about lost teeth, ensuring the magic of the tooth fairy remains alive. Dr. Merchant receives and responds to about three to five emails daily, offering reassurance and advice on dental care. She maintains anonymity, with most of her patients unaware of her secret role. Her kind acts, like reimbursing a child for a tooth lost in a drain, have left a lasting impact, as seen in a heartfelt email from a now 23-year-old who thanked her for her childhood support.
