## Article summary
President Trump, who has long propagated conspiracy theories, now faces backlash from his supporters over his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Despite his attempts to downplay the issue, many of his loyal followers are dissatisfied with the Department of Justice's conclusion and the president's lack of action. This discontent has led to open revolt among some of his base, testing the president's influence over his most dedicated supporters. The situation has raised questions about Trump's ability to control the conspiratorial forces he has cultivated. The Epstein case has struck a particularly sensitive chord, as it touches on the core beliefs of the MAGA movement and the idea of a hidden, corrupt establishment.
