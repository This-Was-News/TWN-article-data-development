## Article summary
Federal regulators repeatedly allowed Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp in Texas, to remove buildings from government flood maps despite evidence suggesting high flood risk. The camp requested FEMA to remove over a dozen buildings from floodplain designations multiple times, including during a major expansion in 2020. Removing structures from these maps can eliminate federal requirements for flood-resistant construction and flood insurance. An analysis by NPR, PBS's FRONTLINE, and data scientists found that many camp buildings were at higher flood risk than indicated by FEMA's maps, with at least 17 structures affected by flash floods in July 2025. The discrepancies between FEMA's maps and private sector models highlight a nationwide issue, with many Americans living in flood-prone areas unaware of the risks.
