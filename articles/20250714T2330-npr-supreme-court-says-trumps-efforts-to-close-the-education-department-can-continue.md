## Article summary
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can continue dismantling the Education Department, overturning a lower court's injunction that had halted the process. The court's decision allows the administration to proceed with laying off nearly 1,400 workers and transferring department functions, despite concerns from states and school districts about irreversible damage. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, calling the decision "indefensible" and warning of a threat to the Constitution's separation of powers. The case originated from a May injunction by a federal judge in Massachusetts, which blocked the administration's executive order to close the department and ordered the rehiring of laid-off employees. The Trump administration argued that the staffing cuts were part of a "streamlining" effort within the executive's authority, while plaintiffs, including 20 states and unions, warned that the damage could be irreversible even if they ultimately win their case.
