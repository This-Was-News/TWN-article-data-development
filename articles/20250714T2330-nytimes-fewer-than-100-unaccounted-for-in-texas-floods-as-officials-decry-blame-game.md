## Article summary
The number of missing people in Texas Hill County has dropped below 100 after the July 4 floods, with Gov. Greg Abbott noting that the actual number may be lower due to erroneous reports. The identification process has been slow in rural Kerr County, where most deaths occurred, due to the lack of a medical examiner. The death toll in Kerr County has risen to 106, with statewide fatalities reaching 132. Officials have faced criticism and threats over their preparedness and response to the floods, with questions raised about delayed evacuations and the use of available warning technologies. Kerr County leaders have expressed frustration, addressing rumors and clarifying the use of American Rescue Plan Act funds for a new communications system.
