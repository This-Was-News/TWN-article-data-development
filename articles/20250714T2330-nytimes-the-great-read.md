## Article summary
Dr. Purva Merchant, a pediatric dentist in Seattle, accidentally became the real-life tooth fairy after receiving an email about a child's lost tooth. She responded, and since then, she has been answering emails from children and parents about lost teeth, ensuring the magic of the tooth fairy remains alive. Dr. Merchant receives around three to five emails daily, to which she responds personally, reassuring children about their lost teeth and encouraging good dental hygiene. Her emails often include a signature line, "Happy growing up!" and she maintains anonymity, with many of her patients unaware of her secret role. The impact of her kindness was highlighted when a 23-year-old woman, who had previously received a response from Dr. Merchant as a child, reached out again after her wisdom tooth extraction, reminding Dr. Merchant of the lasting impact of her actions.
