## Article summary
The appeals court in Washington temporarily halted a trial judge's plan to initiate contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for potentially violating an order to stop Venezuelan migrant flights to El Salvador. Three months later, the appeals court has not advanced the case, allowing it to stall, despite new evidence suggesting the Trump administration may have disregarded the judge's orders. The case stems from the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, with Judge Boasberg ordering flights to stop, which allegedly did not happen. Judge Boasberg threatened contempt proceedings unless the administration provided due process to the deported men, but the appeals court, with a majority of Trump-appointed judges, halted this process. New whistle-blower allegations claim a senior Justice Department official ignored the judge's orders, but the department dismissed the claims as unproven and politically motivated, leading to further inaction from the appeals court.
