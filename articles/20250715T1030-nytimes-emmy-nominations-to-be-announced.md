## Article summary
The Television Academy will announce nominations for the 77th Emmy Awards on Tuesday, with some nominees revealed early and the rest at 11:30 a.m. Eastern. Eligible TV series premiered between June 2024 and May 2025, with strong contenders including Severance, The Pitt, Adolescence, and The Studio. The prime-time Emmys ceremony will air on CBS on September 14, hosted by comedian Nate Bargatze. The entertainment industry faces challenges, with reduced investment in new programming and recovery from strikes in 2023. Emmy submissions declined modestly from last year but significantly from 2022, with drama submissions increasing while comedies and limited series saw declines.
