## Article summary
President Trump is facing backlash from his supporters after downplaying the significance of the Epstein files and defending his administration's handling of the case. A Justice Department and FBI memo stated there was no evidence of Jeffrey Epstein blackmailing powerful individuals or maintaining a "client list," and that his death was a suicide. However, many Trump supporters and right-wing figures, including some within his administration, dispute the official narrative and believe Epstein's death was part of a larger conspiracy. Trump's recent comments urging supporters to move on from the Epstein files have undermined a core belief of the MAGA movement, which posits that a "deep state" controls the government. The backlash has been intense, with figures like Tucker Carlson and Andrew Schulz criticizing the administration's response, while others, like Charlie Kirk, have chosen to trust the administration's handling of the situation.
