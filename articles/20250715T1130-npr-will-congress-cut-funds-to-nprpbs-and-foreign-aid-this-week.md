## Article summary
The Senate is poised to vote this week on the Trump administration's request to cut federal funding for public media and foreign aid programs, with the House having already approved the $9.4 billion spending cuts package. Some Republican senators are advocating for modifications to the cuts, particularly to mitigate the impact on local public media stations and foreign assistance programs like PEPFAR. Concerns have been raised about the potential consequences of eliminating federal support for public broadcasting, which could leave many communities without essential news and emergency services. President Trump has threatened to withhold his endorsement from any Republican opposing the rescissions package, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has warned of potential government shutdowns if the cuts proceed. The Senate will debate the measure this week, with any changes needing approval from the Senate parliamentarian, and the final package must be approved by July 18 to meet the legal deadline.
