## Article summary
Former national security adviser Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, faced intense questioning during his Senate confirmation hearing, particularly regarding a Signal chat scandal where he inadvertently included a journalist in a group discussing military strikes on Yemen. Democrats criticized Waltz's handling of the incident, with Sen. Cory Booker calling it "disqualifying" and accusing Waltz of deflecting blame. Waltz defended his actions, stating that Signal was an authorized communication tool and that no disciplinary action was taken by the White House. Despite the controversy, Senate Republicans largely supported Waltz, with Sen. Jim Risch praising his pragmatism and patriotism. The nomination will proceed to a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, along with two other Trump picks for ambassadorial roles.
