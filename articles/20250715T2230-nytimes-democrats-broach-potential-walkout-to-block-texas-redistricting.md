## Article summary
National Democratic leaders have encouraged Texas House Democrats to consider walking out of a special legislative session to block Republicans from redrawing the state's congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. President Trump has urged Texas congressional Republicans to create five new G.O.P. seats from those held by Democrats, aiming to prevent midterm Democratic gains. During a Democratic call, leaders discussed potential actions to block Trump and Texas Republicans, leaving the impression that a walkout should be considered. A walkout would be politically challenging and financially costly for Democrats, with fines of $500 per day for each member who participates. Despite historical attempts, Republicans have ultimately been able to approve new maps, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has vowed to assist in arresting any Democrats who walk out.
