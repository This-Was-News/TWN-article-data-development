## Article summary
Inflation rose in June, with consumer prices up 2.7% from the previous year and 0.3% from May, driven mainly by rising rents and increased prices in clothing, appliances, and toys. The effects of President Trump's tariffs are becoming evident, with imported clothing prices jumping 1% and the government collecting $27 billion from tariffs in June. Energy and food costs also increased, while prices for new and used cars and airline tickets decreased. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at its upcoming meeting, despite pressure from the White House for rate cuts. However, investors anticipate a rate cut in September.
