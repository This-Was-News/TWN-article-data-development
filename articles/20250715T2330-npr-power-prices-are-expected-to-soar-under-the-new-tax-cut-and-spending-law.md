## Article summary
The law signed by President Trump on July 4, ending tax incentives for wind and solar projects, is expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with significant increases in Republican-led states. Without these tax credits, the cost of wind and solar plants will rise, leading to fewer projects and higher electricity generation costs from natural gas plants. States without policies to drive renewable energy development, such as Oklahoma, Kentucky, Missouri, and Kansas, are expected to see the sharpest increases in electricity rates. The wind and solar industries are in turmoil due to the sudden removal of incentives, with companies scrambling to start projects within a tight timeline. This shift is expected to result in higher electricity rates, reduced investment, fewer jobs, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, with the U.S. missing out on significant progress in clean energy and climate goals.
