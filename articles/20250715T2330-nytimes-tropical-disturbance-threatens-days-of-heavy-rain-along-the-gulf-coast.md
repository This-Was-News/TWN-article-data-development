## Article summary
A tropical disturbance is bringing heavy rain and potential flash flooding to Florida and the central Gulf Coast, with southern Louisiana, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge, being particularly at risk. The National Hurricane Center indicates a 40% chance the system could intensify into a tropical depression before pushing into southern Louisiana on Thursday. Heavy rain is expected to affect Florida through Wednesday, with coastal areas of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana experiencing flooding from Wednesday through the weekend. The disturbance is currently moving westward across central Florida, bringing 2 to 4 inches of rain, and is expected to organize into a tropical depression as it moves over the Gulf. New Orleans could receive 3 to 6 inches of rain from Wednesday through Sunday, with up to 10 inches in the worst-case scenario, while Baton Rouge and the Atchafalaya Basin may also see significant rainfall depending on the disturbance's path.
