## Article summary
The Trump administration has delayed and may cancel approximately $140 million in grants for the Overdose To Action (OD2A) program, which funds fentanyl overdose response efforts across 49 states and numerous local health departments. CDC staffers, speaking anonymously, expressed concerns that the funding disruption could lead to layoffs, program shutdowns, and a reversal of progress in reducing overdose deaths. Public health officials emphasize the critical role of OD2A funding in combating the fentanyl crisis and warn that cuts could have catastrophic consequences. The delay is attributed to bureaucratic confusion involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget, which are scrutinizing the grants before releasing funds. Experts fear that the Trump administration's actions could dismantle the nation's expanded drug treatment safety net, putting public health at risk and potentially leading to increased overdose deaths.
