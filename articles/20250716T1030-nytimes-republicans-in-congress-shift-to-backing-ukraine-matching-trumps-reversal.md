## Article summary
Republicans in Congress have shifted their stance on Ukraine, now backing aid following President Trump's reversal. This change reflects Trump's influence over the party, as many Republicans who previously opposed Ukraine aid now support it. Some Republicans, like Representative Derrick Van Orden and Representative Troy Nehls, have publicly endorsed Trump's new plan for Ukraine, despite their past opposition. Others, like Vice President JD Vance and Senator Rick Scott, have notably softened their stance on Ukraine aid. However, some Republicans, such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, remain critical of Trump's new position, arguing that it betrays the voters who elected Republicans based on promises to end U.S. involvement in foreign wars.
