## Article summary
A federal judge has ruled that medical debt can remain on Americans' credit reports, overturning a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule aimed at removing medical bills from credit reports. The CFPB had argued that medical debt is not a reliable indicator of a borrower's creditworthiness, citing its 2014 research. However, the judge agreed with the Cornerstone Credit Union League's lawsuit, which claimed the CFPB had exceeded its authority. Advocacy groups criticized the ruling, while the Consumer Data Industry Association supported it, stating that medical debt information is crucial for assessing a consumer's ability to pay. The ruling affects nearly a third of the U.S. population carrying healthcare debt, with over a dozen states having laws to prevent medical debt from impacting credit reports.
