## Article summary
The Senate is debating a package of funding cuts requested by President Trump, targeting $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and $7.9 billion for international aid. The cuts to CPB, which funds NPR and PBS, were narrowly advanced after a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, opposed the cuts, citing concerns about the impact on local public media and the need for congressional oversight. A compromise was reached to continue funding 28 Native American radio stations, but Native Public Radio criticized the plan as impractical. The Senate has until midnight Friday to approve the package, which will then return to the House for a final vote.
