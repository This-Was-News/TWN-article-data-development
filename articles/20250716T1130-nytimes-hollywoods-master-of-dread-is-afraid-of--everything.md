## Article summary
Ari Aster, the director behind unsettling films like "Hereditary," "Midsommar," and "Beau Is Afraid," is known for his pervasive dread and anxiety, which he channels into his work. His latest film, "Eddington," explores themes of isolation, paranoia, and disinformation, set during the height of the Covid pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement. Aster's films often feature intense, personal dread and have been both critically acclaimed and commercially successful, though his latest works have seen diminishing returns. Despite his public persona, Aster is deeply private and uncomfortable discussing himself, preferring to focus on his films and the ideas behind them. His friends and collaborators describe him as a brilliant but neurotic artist who uses filmmaking as a means of processing his anxieties and fears.
