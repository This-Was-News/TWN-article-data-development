## Article summary
President Trump has criticized Republicans calling for transparency in the Jeffrey Epstein probe, dismissing it as a "hoax" and accusing Democrats of using it as a "scam." He has also lashed out at some of his own supporters for believing in the conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death. Despite promising to release more information about Epstein's death during his election campaign, Trump's Justice Department has denied the existence of a "client list" and refused to make additional documents public. Prominent Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have called for more transparency in the case. Trump has insisted that his supporters should not focus on Epstein, but rather on his administration's achievements, and has expressed full confidence in the DOJ and FBI's handling of the case.
