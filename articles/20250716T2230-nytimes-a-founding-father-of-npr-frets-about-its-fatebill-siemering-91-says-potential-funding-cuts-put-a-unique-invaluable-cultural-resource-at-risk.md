## Article summary
Bill Siemering, a key figure in the creation of NPR, has witnessed the network's evolution over more than five decades. He authored NPR's original mission statement and co-founded its flagship show, All Things Considered. Currently, Congress is considering a proposal to defund public media, which Siemering argues would jeopardize a vital cultural resource. He attributes the current threats to a divisive culture that undervalues inclusion, diversity, and factual reporting. Despite these challenges, Siemering believes in the enduring relevance of NPR's mission and its continued importance in the digital age.
