## Article summary
Scientists have successfully created "three-parent" babies using a technique that prevents mitochondrial disorders, as detailed in a landmark study. The procedure involves transferring nuclear DNA from a couple's fertilized egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, resulting in babies with DNA from three sources. Eight children born through this method appear healthy, offering hope to families at risk of passing on devastating genetic diseases. While the results are encouraging, critics raise concerns about potential risks and the ethical implications of genetic manipulation. The technique is currently restricted in the U.S. but has been used in other countries, with ongoing debates about its safety and long-term effects.
