## Article summary
Israel launched airstrikes on Damascus, Syria, targeting the Defense Ministry and an area near the presidential palace to defend the Druze minority in southern Syria, following clashes between Syrian government forces and Druze militias in Sweida. The strikes killed three people and wounded 34, according to Syria's Health Ministry, and led to a renewed ceasefire agreement. The violence in southern Syria has resulted in hundreds of deaths, including civilians and soldiers, amid sectarian clashes and revenge attacks. Israel's actions have been condemned by Syria, the U.N., Turkey, and the UAE, while the U.S. is engaged in diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation. The conflict comes at a delicate time, with the U.S. lifting most sanctions on Syria and working to improve ties between Israel and Syria.
