## Article summary
Anil Ambalal Patel, a 60-year-old widower from Ahmedabad, India, lost his son Harshit and daughter-in-law Pooja in the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 240 people. The couple had moved to Britain for better opportunities and were visiting Mr. Patel when they perished. Mr. Patel, who had faced years of hardship and loss, including his wife Uma's death from breast cancer, found joy and support in Harshit and Pooja. The family's journey from poverty to the middle class was abruptly ended by the crash, leaving Mr. Patel devastated and alone. After a difficult process of identifying the bodies and conducting funerals, Mr. Patel scattered the ashes of Harshit and Pooja in the Narmada River, reflecting on the profound loneliness he now faces.
