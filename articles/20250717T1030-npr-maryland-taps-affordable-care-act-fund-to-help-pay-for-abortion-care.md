## Article summary
Maryland has enacted a law allowing funds collected from insurers under the Affordable Care Act to be used for abortion care, making it the first state to do so. This move aims to address the increased demand for abortions in Maryland since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, with many patients traveling from states where abortion is restricted or illegal. The funds, which come from fees paid by insurance companies participating in the ACA marketplaces, will be used to support abortion funds operating in Maryland, helping both out-of-state patients and low-income or uninsured Marylanders. Maryland's account has grown to $25 million, with the new law allowing up to $2.5 million annually to be allocated in grants to these funds. The law has faced opposition from anti-abortion groups, who argue that it forces some insurance consumers to pay for procedures they may not agree with.
