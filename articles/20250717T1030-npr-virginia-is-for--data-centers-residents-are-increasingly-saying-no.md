## Article summary
Virginia has become a hub for data centers, hosting nearly 600 facilities, including 150 hyperscale centers. Residents are increasingly opposing these centers due to concerns about power consumption, water usage, noise, and environmental impact. Community activist Elena Schlossberg has been a prominent figure in organizing resistance against data center developments. Chesapeake, Virginia, recently saw a successful campaign by residents to block a proposed data center, highlighting the growing not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) movement. Despite economic benefits, the tension between the need for data centers to support AI and other digital services and the environmental and quality-of-life concerns of residents remains unresolved.
