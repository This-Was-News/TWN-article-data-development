## Article summary
A devastating fire tore through a shopping mall in the eastern Iraqi city of Kut, resulting in the deaths of around 50 people, including men, women, and children. Mohammad al-Mayahy, the provincial governor, declared three days of mourning and announced legal proceedings against the building owner, the mall owner, and others involved. The governor emphasized that there would be no leniency for those responsible, hinting at suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident. The fire is the latest in a series of deadly blazes in Iraq, following a 2023 wedding hall fire that killed over 100 people and two 2021 hospital fires that claimed at least 174 lives. The ownership of the building and the exact cause of the fire remain unclear.
