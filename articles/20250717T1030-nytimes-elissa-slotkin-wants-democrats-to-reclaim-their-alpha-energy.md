## Article summary
Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, is advocating for her party to present a clear, affirmative vision to counter Republican narratives and reclaim political power. She argues that Democrats need to move beyond defensive strategies and offer bold, emotionally resonant policies that prioritize key issues like the economy and immigration. Slotkin criticizes the party's lack of unified leadership, comparing it to a solar system without a central sun, and emphasizes the need for fresh, innovative leadership. She highlights the party's messaging failures, noting that Democrats often prioritize everything, which ultimately means prioritizing nothing. Slotkin also discusses the importance of establishing clear rules on immigration and encouraging a new generation of leaders to engage early in the political process.
