## Article summary
The Senate has approved a $9 billion rescission package proposed by the Trump administration, which includes cutting $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and $7.9 billion from other programs, including foreign aid. The CPB funds NPR, PBS, and their member stations, and the cuts could lead to the closure of local stations, particularly in rural areas. The vote was largely along party lines, with Democrats opposing the cuts and most Republicans supporting them, except for Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. The approval sets up a final showdown in the House, which previously passed an earlier version of the bill. Leaders in public broadcasting have warned that losing CPB funding would cripple small stations and weaken the entire public media network, while a recent poll shows that two-thirds of Americans support federal funding for public radio.
