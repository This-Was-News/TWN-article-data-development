## Article summary
Virginia is experiencing a surge in data center construction, with nearly 600 facilities, including 150 hyperscale centers, due to increased demand from AI applications like ChatGPT. Residents are increasingly opposing these centers, citing concerns about power and water consumption, noise from cooling systems, and environmental impact. Community activist Elena Schlossberg has become a key figure in organizing resistance, with similar movements emerging in other states. In Chesapeake, Virginia, residents successfully blocked a proposed data center through organized opposition and a unanimous city council vote. Despite growing resistance, the need for data centers continues to rise, creating a tension between technological demand and community concerns.
