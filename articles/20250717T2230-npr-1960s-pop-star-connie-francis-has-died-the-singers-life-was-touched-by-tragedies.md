## Article summary
Connie Francis, the first female singer to top the Billboard Hot 100 with hits like "Who's Sorry Now?" and "Everybody's Somebody's Fool," has died at 87. Born Concetta Franconero, she changed her name at 13 and rose to fame in the 1950s and 1960s, selling over 40 million records before turning 25. Her life was marked by tragedies, including the murder of a close friend, a botched nasal surgery that damaged her singing ability, and a brutal rape in 1974, which she publicly fought in court. Despite these challenges, she returned to performing and continued to make appearances into her 80s. Recently, her song "Pretty Little Baby" gained viral fame on TikTok.
