## Article summary
President Trump has been criticized for his response to the Justice Department's handling of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, with some Republicans calling for more transparency. Trump has dismissed the case as a "hoax" and lashed out at both Democrats and some of his own supporters for focusing on it. He has also criticized Republicans who disagree with him, calling them "stupid" and "foolish." Despite calls for more transparency, Trump has insisted that his supporters should forget about Epstein and has expressed full confidence in the DOJ and FBI. Some in the MAGA movement feel betrayed by Trump's stance, as Epstein's story is a key part of the QAnon conspiracy theory that Trump has previously embraced.
