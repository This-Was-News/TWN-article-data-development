## Article summary
The Senate has approved a $9 billion rescission package proposed by the Trump administration, which includes cutting $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and $7.9 billion from other programs, including foreign aid. The CPB funds NPR, PBS, and their member stations, and the cuts could lead to the closure of local stations, particularly in rural areas. The vote was largely along party lines, with Democrats opposing the bill and most Republicans supporting it, except for Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. NPR and PBS leaders have expressed concern that the cuts will harm their ability to provide essential services, such as emergency alerts and educational programming. The House is expected to approve the Senate's changes before a midnight Friday deadline, and the White House has indicated that more rescission requests are likely.
