## Article summary
Rachel Dawson, a former diversity administrator at the University of Michigan, has sued the university for racial and gender discrimination, alleging bias in its investigation of antisemitic comments she was accused of making. Dawson denies the accusations and claims the university's process was unfair, highlighting historical stereotypes against Black women. The university maintains that Dawson was fired for making antisemitic remarks while representing the institution. The incident occurred amid campus debates over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the university's diversity efforts. Dawson's lawsuit also questions the independence of the law firm hired to investigate the matter, citing a potential conflict of interest.
