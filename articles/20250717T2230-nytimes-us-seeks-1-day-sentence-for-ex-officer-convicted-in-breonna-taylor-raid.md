## Article summary
The Justice Department has requested a one-day prison sentence for former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison, who was convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during a botched 2020 drug raid. The request, made by Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet K. Dhillon, argues that Hankison has already faced significant penalties and that the prosecution was excessive. The filing has drawn criticism from Taylor's family and former civil rights division attorneys, who view it as a politically motivated reversal of efforts to address racial disparities in policing. The case has highlighted issues with no-knock warrants and has led to broader scrutiny of the Louisville Metro Police Department. The Justice Department's civil rights division has undergone significant changes under the Trump administration, with a shift in focus away from systemic discrimination cases.
