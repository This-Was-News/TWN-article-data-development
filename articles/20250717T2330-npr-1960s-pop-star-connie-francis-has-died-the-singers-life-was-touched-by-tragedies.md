## Article summary
Connie Francis, the first female singer to top the Billboard Hot 100, has died at 87. Known for hits like "Who's Sorry Now?" and "Everybody's Somebody's Fool," she sold over 40 million records before turning 25. Her life was marked by tragedies, including the murder of a close friend, a botched surgery that damaged her singing ability, and a brutal rape in 1974. Despite these hardships, Francis continued performing and even regained her voice after multiple surgeries. She remained active in the music industry until her retirement and gained renewed popularity recently with her song "Pretty Little Baby" going viral on TikTok.
