## Article summary
President Trump has criticized Republicans calling for transparency in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, dismissing it as a "hoax" and attacking both Democrats and some of his own supporters. He claimed that the case, involving the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019, is a distraction from his administration's achievements. Despite earlier promises to release related files, Trump now insists supporters should focus on other issues, while prominent Republicans and conservative voices continue to demand more transparency. Trump has expressed full confidence in the Justice Department and FBI's handling of the case, despite backlash from some in the MAGA movement who feel betrayed. The situation highlights the tension between Trump's shifting stance and the beliefs of conspiracy theorists who see Epstein's story as part of a larger narrative involving powerful figures.
