## Article summary
The Senate has approved a $9 billion rescission package, cutting $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and $7.9 billion from other programs, including foreign aid. The vote was largely along party lines, with Democrats opposing the cuts and most Republicans supporting them. The cuts aim to reduce federal funding for public broadcasting, which supports NPR, PBS, and their member stations. Senators introduced various amendments, with some Republicans like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski expressing concerns about the impact on public broadcasting and foreign aid programs. The House is expected to approve the Senate's changes before a midnight Friday deadline, marking 45 days since President Trump sent the rescission request to Congress.
