## Article summary
The Department of Justice requested that California sheriffs provide lists of non-U.S. citizen inmates, including their crimes and release dates, threatening legal action if they did not comply. This move aligns with increased White House pressure on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest more undocumented immigrants and follows recent federal immigration raids in Southern California. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the administration's priority of removing "criminal illegal aliens" and expressed willingness to cooperate with California sheriffs. The American Civil Liberties Union warned that complying with the request might violate California's sanctuary state law, which prohibits local resources from being used for federal immigration enforcement. The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department and San Francisco Sheriff Paul Miyamoto both rejected the request, citing their policies against participating in civil immigration enforcement.
