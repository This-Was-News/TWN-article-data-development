## Article summary
The article follows four Belton High School students—Joseph, Bryson, Erik, and Jack—as they prepare to defend their title in the national SkillsUSA TeamWorks competition, where they must build a tiny house in just two days. The team, coached by Michael Carillo, faces intense pressure to live up to the legacy of their predecessors, who won the previous year. Despite their lack of experience compared to other teams, the students train rigorously, developing a strong bond and learning to work together effectively. During the competition, they encounter challenges such as time management, precise measurements, and unexpected setbacks, but they persevere and complete their project just in time. Although they ultimately secure second place, the team reflects on their journey, the lessons they've learned, and the pride they take in their hard work and camaraderie.
