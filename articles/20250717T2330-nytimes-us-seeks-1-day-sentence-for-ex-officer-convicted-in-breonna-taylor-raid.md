## Article summary
The Justice Department has requested a one-day prison sentence for former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison, convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during a 2020 raid. The request, made by Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, argues that Hankison has already faced significant penalties, including losing his job and being barred from law enforcement. The family of Breonna Taylor expressed outrage, demanding a sentence in accordance with federal guidelines, while former civil rights division attorney Samantha Trepel criticized the request as political interference. Hankison was the only officer charged in the botched operation that led to Taylor's death, with the incident sparking nationwide protests and scrutiny of no-knock warrants. The Justice Department's request comes amid broader shifts in the division's priorities under the Trump administration, including a focus on cases aligned with the president's agenda and a reduction in investigations into systemic discrimination.
