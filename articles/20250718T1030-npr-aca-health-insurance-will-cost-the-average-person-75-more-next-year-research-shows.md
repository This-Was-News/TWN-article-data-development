## Article summary
The analysis from KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, shows that the average person who buys Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance will face a 75% increase in premiums next year. Insurance companies are attributing the rise to the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, which were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and significantly reduced premium costs. The enhanced subsidies led to a record enrollment of 24 million people in January, driving the uninsured rate to its lowest level ever. With the subsidies ending, premiums are expected to spike, potentially leading to 4.2 million more uninsured people as healthier individuals may opt out. Congress could extend the subsidies, but this is unlikely due to opposition from Republican lawmakers, who argue that the subsidies perpetuate rising premiums and federal bailouts.
