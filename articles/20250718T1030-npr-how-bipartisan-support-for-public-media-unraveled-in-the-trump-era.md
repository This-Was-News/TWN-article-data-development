## Article summary
The article discusses the loss of bipartisan support for public media, particularly PBS and NPR, during the Trump era. Congress voted to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting, citing left-leaning bias and waste of taxpayer funds. The funding cut, amounting to $1.1 billion, is part of a broader political strategy to pay for other priorities. The loss of federal subsidy threatens the survival of many local stations, especially those serving rural or tribal audiences. The article also explores the intensifying scrutiny on national networks and the debate over journalism and government funding in the U.S.
