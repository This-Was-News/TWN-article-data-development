## Article summary
President Donald Trump has threatened to sue *The Wall Street Journal* over an article that claims he contributed a lewd birthday letter to a compilation given to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. The article alleges that a book of birthday letters from that year, including one with Trump's signature and a naked woman's outline, was part of an Epstein investigation. Trump called the story "false, malicious, and defamatory" and warned the *Journal* and Rupert Murdoch of legal action if it was published. He also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to release some files from Epstein's criminal case, though not the full court records. Trump has faced backlash after a Justice Department and FBI review found no evidence to support conspiracy theories about Epstein's life and death.
