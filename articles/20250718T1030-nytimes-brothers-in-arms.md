## Article summary
The leaders of Britain, France, and Germany are strengthening their alliances and defense partnerships in response to shifting U.S. commitments and growing concerns about European security. Recent agreements include a mutual defense treaty between Britain and Germany, coordination of nuclear arsenals between Britain and France, and plans for a Europe-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine. These efforts are seen as a supplement to existing alliances like NATO, providing a more nimble and independent framework for addressing European security challenges. The leaders are also pushing for increased defense spending and closer cooperation to counter Russia's aggression and ensure European autonomy. While they aim to maintain ties with the U.S., their actions reflect a growing need for Europe to take responsibility for its own security in a changing geopolitical landscape.
