## Article summary
Prescription drug denials by private insurers in the U.S. increased by 25% from 2016 to 2023, with denial rates rising from 18.3% to 22.9%, according to an analysis by Komodo Health for The New York Times. The data reveals that major insurers, including UnitedHealthcare, have seen a rise in rejections, contributing to public frustration with the private health insurance system. Experts suggest that factors like the high costs of new weight loss medications and increased automation of claims processes may have driven the rise in denials. The analysis also highlights that decisions to deny claims are often made by pharmacy benefit managers and large employers, with prior authorization being a significant factor in denials. While insurers argue that many denials are resolved or due to incomplete claims, recent studies have shown that denials can lead to harmful interruptions in necessary medications, particularly for patients with serious conditions like cancer.
