## Article summary
Venezuela has freed 10 Americans in exchange for Venezuelans detained in El Salvador, as confirmed by U.S. and Salvadoran governments. The swap, negotiated over months, involved Venezuelan political prisoners and individuals accused of gang affiliations. Among those released were U.S. citizens and permanent residents designated as wrongfully detained, including Wilbert Joseph Castaneda and Lucas Hunter. The exchange followed the deportation of about 250 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, with lawyers arguing their transfer was illegal. Families of the Venezuelan migrants expressed relief upon learning of the swap, which was kept secret until its announcement.
