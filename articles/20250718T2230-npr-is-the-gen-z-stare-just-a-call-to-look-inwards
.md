## Article summary
The "Gen Z stare" is a viral term describing the tendency of Generation Z to stare blankly at others during interactions, categorized into the "customer service stare" and the "customer stare." This phenomenon has sparked generational debates, reminiscent of historical critiques of youth. Social media expert Jennifer Grygiel suggests that the stare may not be unique to Gen Z but could stem from boredom, lack of social experience, or a preference for authentic interactions. Gen Z members argue that their upbringing during the digital age may contribute to social awkwardness. Grygiel also notes that criticizing Gen Z may reflect broader societal issues and the need for more enriching interpersonal interactions.
