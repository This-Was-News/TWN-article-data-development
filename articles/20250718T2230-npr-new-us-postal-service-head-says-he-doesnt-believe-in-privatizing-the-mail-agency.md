## Article summary
New U.S. Postal Service head David Steiner has publicly stated his opposition to privatizing the USPS, advocating for its current structure as a self-financing, independent entity. Steiner's appointment has raised concerns due to his background at FedEx, a competitor, but he has addressed these by stating that any potential conflicts of interest have been or will be resolved. Union leaders have expressed cautious optimism about Steiner's support for a strong public Postal Service, while also emphasizing the need for actions to back up his words. The USPS has recently raised stamp prices to help stabilize its finances, marking the seventh increase in four years. There is bipartisan opposition in Congress to privatizing the USPS, with a resolution gaining support to keep the service as an independent federal agency.
