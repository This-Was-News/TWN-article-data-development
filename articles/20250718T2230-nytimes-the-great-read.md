## Article summary
Lou Schachter, a retired corporate consultant and true crime enthusiast, became intrigued by the 1985 theft of Willem de Kooning's "Woman-Ochre" from the University of Arizona Museum of Art after seeing the empty frame during a visit in 2014. The painting resurfaced in 2017, recovered from the estate of Jerome and Rita Alter, retired public schoolteachers. Schachter's curiosity led him to investigate further, uncovering a connection to two other stolen paintings, "Aspens" by Victor Higgins and "Oklahoma Cheyenne" by Joseph Henry Sharp, which were taken from the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, New Mexico, in 1985. Schachter's research and subsequent email to the Harwood's director, Juniper Leherissey, prompted an F.B.I. investigation, resulting in the recovery of the two paintings in 2024. The paintings are now on display at the Harwood Museum, and Schachter remains convinced that the Alters may have stolen and resold other artworks, though he lacks definitive proof.
