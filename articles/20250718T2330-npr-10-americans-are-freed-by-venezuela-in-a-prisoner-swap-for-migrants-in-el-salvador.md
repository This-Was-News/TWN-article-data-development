## Article summary
Venezuela has freed 10 Americans, including U.S. citizens and permanent residents designated as "wrongfully detained," in exchange for Venezuelans held in El Salvador. The swap also included an unspecified number of Venezuelan political prisoners. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele confirmed the exchange, noting it was the result of months of negotiations with U.S. officials. The Venezuelans handed over were accused of being part of the Tren de Aragua gang, though some argue their transfer to El Salvador was illegal. The prisoner swap was kept secret until its announcement, with some relatives learning about it through social media.
