## Article summary
The "Gen Z stare" is a viral term describing the tendency of Generation Z to stare blankly at others during interactions, categorized as either the "customer service stare" or the "customer stare." This phenomenon has sparked debates, with some viewing it as a generational clash, while others, like social media expert Jennifer Grygiel, argue it may not be unique to Gen Z and could stem from boredom or lack of engaging interactions. Grygiel suggests that Gen Z values authenticity and may struggle with awkward social situations due to limited real-world experience and increased screen time. The discussion around the "Gen Z stare" may reflect broader societal issues, with young people often becoming the target of criticism for larger social ills. Ultimately, the phenomenon highlights the need for more enriching interpersonal interactions and a deeper understanding of generational differences.
