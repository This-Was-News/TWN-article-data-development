## Article summary
Postmaster General David Steiner has publicly stated his opposition to privatizing the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), affirming his support for its current structure as a self-financing, independent entity. Steiner's appointment has raised concerns due to his background at FedEx, a competitor to USPS, and his past stock ownership in the company, which USPS has addressed by ensuring compliance with conflict-of-interest laws. Despite initial worries, Steiner's clear stance has eased some concerns among union leaders, although they remain vigilant about potential shifts in business practices. The USPS has recently raised stamp prices by nearly 7% to help stabilize its finances, marking the seventh price increase in four years. There is bipartisan opposition in Congress to privatizing USPS, with a resolution gaining support to keep the agency independent.
