## Article summary
The article "The Politics of the War on Empathy" explores the contentious role of empathy in contemporary politics, particularly in the context of the MAGA movement and broader cultural debates. It highlights how empathy has been both championed as a virtue and criticized as a weakness, with figures like Elon Musk and right-wing Christians arguing that excessive empathy is self-destructive. The article also notes that progressives have their own critiques of empathy, viewing it as sometimes complacent or ineffective. The history of the concept of empathy is traced, from its origins in German aesthetics to its modern understanding as a tool for moral reasoning. Ultimately, the article argues that while empathy is complex and sometimes flawed, dismissing it entirely can lead to a dangerous erosion of shared humanity.
