## Article summary
Lou Schachter, a retired corporate consultant, became intrigued by the 1985 theft of Willem de Kooning's "Woman-Ochre" from the University of Arizona Museum of Art, which was later found in the estate of Jerome and Rita Alter. Schachter's curiosity led him to investigate further, and he discovered that the Alters may have also stolen two other paintings, "Aspens" by Victor Higgins and "Oklahoma Cheyenne" by Joseph Henry Sharp, from the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, New Mexico, in 1985. Schachter's research, which included online searches and a visit to an antique store, uncovered connections between the thefts and led him to contact the Harwood Museum's director. The F.B.I., with the help of Schachter's findings, recovered the stolen paintings, which were returned to the Harwood Museum and are now on display. Schachter believes the Alters may have stolen other artworks and continues to investigate, driven by his interest in true crime and unsolved mysteries.
