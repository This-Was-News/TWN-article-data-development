## Article summary
The Texas Legislature passed a bipartisan law, The Life of the Mother Act, to clarify emergency exceptions to the state's abortion ban. The law specifies that a woman's death or impairment does not have to be imminent for the exception to apply, allows doctors to discuss abortion as a treatment option, and shifts the burden of proof to the state in cases of alleged violations. While the law is seen as a step forward by some, including Dr. Emily Briggs, others like Amanda Zurawski, who nearly died due to delays in care, view it as a minimal improvement. The law does not add exceptions for rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies, which remains a concern for medical groups. The impact of the law will depend on how doctors interpret it and whether it prevents tragedies in real-time medical emergencies.
