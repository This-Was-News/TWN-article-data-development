## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has requested that states provide personal data of tens of millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients by July 30. This data includes names, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers, and benefit amounts. The USDA's demand has sparked a federal lawsuit, with plaintiffs arguing the agency is violating federal privacy laws and not following proper protocols. Concerns have been raised about the potential use of this data for immigration enforcement and other purposes not related to SNAP. Several states have expressed concerns or are reviewing the USDA's request, while others plan to comply. The USDA has stated the data will be used to ensure program integrity and verify immigration status, but critics argue the agency's notice is overbroad and unlawful.
