## Article summary
President Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit against *The Wall Street Journal*, NewsCorp, its executives, and the reporters who wrote an article about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, seeking at least $10 billion in damages. The article discussed a birthday letter allegedly signed by Trump, which he denies writing, and was part of an Epstein investigation. Trump called the story "false, malicious, and defamatory" and threatened legal action before its publication. He also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to release some Epstein case files, though not the full records. The lawsuit and Trump's responses come amid backlash from his base after a Justice Department and FBI review found no evidence supporting conspiracy theories about Epstein's life and death.
