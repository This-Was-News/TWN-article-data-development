## Article summary
Vance Boelter, a former college freshman who experienced a dramatic shift in his religious beliefs, is awaiting trial for murder and other charges after a shooting spree in Minnesota. Boelter's life took a dark turn as his fortunes declined, and he became increasingly distant, following far-right conspiracy theories and becoming involved in various failed businesses and nonprofits. In June 2025, Boelter drove to the homes of Democratic legislators, killing two and critically wounding two others, with prosecutors suggesting his actions were motivated by a twisted sense of doing good. Boelter's cryptic messages and notes suggest he was in the throes of grandiose delusion, believing himself chosen to save the country by taking extreme action. Despite his religious beliefs and lack of a known history of violence, Boelter's actions have left his family and community in shock and mourning.
