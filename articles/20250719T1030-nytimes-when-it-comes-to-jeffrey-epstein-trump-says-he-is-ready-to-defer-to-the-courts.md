## Article summary
President Trump, who has often criticized judges and questioned the courts' role, has taken a different stance regarding Jeffrey Epstein's case, deferring to the courts on the release of grand jury materials. He requested Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce relevant grand jury testimony, subject to court approval, following reports of a suggestive birthday greeting he sent Epstein. While the president's assertion aligns with normal criminal procedure, his administration has previously sought to undermine the judiciary's role. Legal scholars note a contradiction in Trump's approach, with some arguing that his stance on the Epstein case is a flip-flop compared to his usual hostility toward the courts. The administration has criticized district-court judges, with Trump using harsh language and even calling for impeachments, prompting concerns about rising threats to judges.
