## Article summary
The Texas Legislature passed a bipartisan law, The Life of the Mother Act, to clarify emergency exceptions to the state's abortion ban. The law aims to address uncertainties doctors face when performing abortions in medical emergencies, with penalties for misinterpretations being severe. Key clarifications include specifying that a woman's death or impairment doesn't have to be imminent for the exception to apply, allowing doctors to discuss abortion options, and shifting the burden of proof to the state in legal cases. While the law is seen as a step forward by some, including Dr. Emily Briggs, others like Amanda Zurawski, who nearly died due to delays in care, view it as a minimal improvement. The law's effectiveness remains uncertain, with experts like Mary Ziegler noting that its impact will depend on individual interpretations and real-world applications.
