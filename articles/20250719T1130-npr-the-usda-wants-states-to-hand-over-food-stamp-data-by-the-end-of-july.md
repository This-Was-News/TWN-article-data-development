## Article summary
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has requested that states provide detailed personal information of tens of millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients by July 30. This data includes names, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers, and benefit amounts, with non-compliant states risking loss of funds. The demand has sparked a federal lawsuit from SNAP recipients and advocacy groups, who argue the USDA is violating federal privacy laws and has not followed proper protocols. Concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of this data, particularly for immigration enforcement, as the Trump administration has been collecting personal data for various purposes. The USDA claims the data will ensure program integrity and verify immigration status, but critics argue the move could turn SNAP into a tool for government mass surveillance.
