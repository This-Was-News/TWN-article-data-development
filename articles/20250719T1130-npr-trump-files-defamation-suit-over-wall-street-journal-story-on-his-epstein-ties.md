## Article summary
President Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit against *The Wall Street Journal*, NewsCorp, and others over an article detailing his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, including a disputed birthday letter. The suit seeks at least $10 billion in damages and names key figures like Rupert Murdoch and the reporters involved. Trump claims the letter is fake and has repeatedly threatened legal action, calling the *Journal* a "pile of garbage newspaper." He also announced plans to release some Epstein-related files, though not the full court records. The lawsuit follows backlash from Trump's base after a DOJ and FBI review found no evidence supporting Epstein conspiracy theories, with Trump and allies previously pushing for the release of such files.
