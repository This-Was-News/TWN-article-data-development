## Article summary
Vance Boelter, a former college freshman who had a sudden and intense spiritual shift, is awaiting trial for the Minnesota shootings that killed two Democratic legislators and critically wounded two others. Boelter's life took a dramatic turn from being an affable student to a man consumed by religious fervor and later, far-right conspiracy theories. His fortunes declined, and he struggled with his spiritual and business interests, moving frequently and starting several short-lived ventures. In the lead-up to the shootings, Boelter's mental state deteriorated, and he developed a strong distrust of government, particularly Democrats. On June 14, Boelter carried out a targeted attack on Democratic lawmakers, leaving behind cryptic notes and claims of a two-year undercover investigation, but his motives remain unclear.
