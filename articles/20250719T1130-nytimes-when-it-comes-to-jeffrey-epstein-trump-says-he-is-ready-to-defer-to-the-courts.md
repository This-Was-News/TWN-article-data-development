## Article summary
President Trump has typically criticized federal judges and questioned the courts' role as a check on presidential power. However, in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, Trump has deferred to the courts, stating that judges should decide on the release of grand jury materials related to Epstein's sex trafficking indictment. This stance contrasts with his administration's usual rhetoric undermining the judiciary, particularly district-court judges who oversee grand juries. Legal experts note that Trump's position on the Epstein case represents a flip-flop on the role of judges, given his broader hostility toward the courts. The administration has faced criticism for its severe tone and calls for judges' impeachment, with some urging Trump to moderate his language amid rising threats to judges.
