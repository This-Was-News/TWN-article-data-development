## Article summary
The WNBA's success from the previous year has continued into 2025, with TV ratings up 23% and attendance increasing by 13%, leading to plans for expansion to 18 teams by 2030. The league's growth is attributed to strategic business moves, including improved digital offerings, expanded broadcast access, and scheduling preseason games in star players' college towns. Expansion fees for new teams have risen significantly, and the league has secured a record-breaking $2.2 billion media rights deal. Players are pushing for a new collective bargaining agreement to address low salaries and other financial issues, with concerns about increased game schedules and player injuries. Despite the progress, some believe the league missed opportunities for even greater success due to past skepticism, but NBA ownership groups are now showing renewed interest.
