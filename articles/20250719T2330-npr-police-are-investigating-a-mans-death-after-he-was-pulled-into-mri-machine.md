## Article summary
Police in New York's Nassau County are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who was pulled into an MRI machine while wearing a large metallic chain. The incident occurred on Wednesday at Nassau Open MRI in Westbury, where the chain caused the man to be drawn into the machine, resulting in a medical episode. He died from his injuries the following day. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that MRI machines create strong magnetic fields that can attract and pull on metallic objects, posing physical hazards. The FDA emphasizes the importance of screening individuals and objects entering the MRI environment to prevent such incidents.
