## Article summary
The U.S. has shifted its stance on cryptocurrencies with the passage of the first major crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act, signed by President Trump. This law sets new rules for stablecoins and paves the way for further crypto-related legislation, including the CLARITY Act, which aims to transfer regulatory power to a smaller body. Crypto advocates see this as a step towards financial innovation, highlighting the potential of stablecoins for instant, borderless transactions. Critics argue the regulations are too weak and influenced by heavy lobbying from the crypto industry, which has spent millions on campaign donations. Despite the criticism, the crypto sector is optimistic, backed by President Trump and aiming to pass the CLARITY Act to reduce oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
