## Article summary
President Trump has called for the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier accused of sexually trafficking children. The Department of Justice has also requested that a federal judge unseal the testimony, citing public interest. Trump has denied any involvement in Epstein's allegations and has criticized lawmakers and supporters interested in the Epstein materials. The release of Epstein-related files has been demanded by both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, with some introducing measures to force a House vote on the matter. The DOJ recently released a memo stating that no evidence was found of Epstein keeping a "client list" or blackmailing associates, contradicting past statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi.
