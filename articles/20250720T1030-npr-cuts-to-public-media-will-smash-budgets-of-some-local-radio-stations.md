## Article summary
President Trump's push to cut federal funding for public media, citing political bias, has severely impacted small rural radio stations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves remote areas in West Virginia and Virginia. Allegheny Mountain Radio, a cooperative of three stations, relies on federal funding for up to 65% of its annual budget, and the recent $1.1 billion cut could threaten its existence. The station provides essential local news, information, and community services, including reporting on local government, missing pets, and even obituaries. Local officials and residents, many of whom voted for Trump, emphasize the station's critical role in keeping the community informed, especially in areas with poor internet and cell phone connectivity. Despite some backlash from listeners who perceive NPR's newscast as liberal propaganda, the station's staff and supporters argue that defunding public media harms rural communities and undermines institutions that provide vital information.
