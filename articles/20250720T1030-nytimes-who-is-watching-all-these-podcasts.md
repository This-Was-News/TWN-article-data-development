## Article summary
Popular podcasts like Joe Rogan and Theo Von have transitioned to video formats, with episodes lasting several hours, yet attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers. The audience for video podcasts is primarily podcast consumers who are near a screen, with nearly three-quarters playing podcast videos, even if minimized. About 30% of podcast consumers watch videos in the background, while the rest actively watch, though YouTube's view metrics make it difficult to define a typical viewer. Video podcasts have integrated into social media, with clips appearing on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, and many ad deals now require a video component. Despite the rise of video podcasts, audio remains the primary way most consumers experience podcasts, with 58% listening to only audio or backgrounded video.
