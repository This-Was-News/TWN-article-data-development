## Article summary
Israeli troops killed at least 32 Palestinians near food distribution hubs run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in southern Gaza, according to witnesses and hospital officials. The shootings occurred as crowds gathered near the hubs, with witnesses alleging indiscriminate fire from Israeli forces. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by the U.S. and Israel, aims to replace the U.N.-led aid system, but local officials report hundreds killed while trying to reach these sites. Gaza faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with chaotic food distributions and ongoing airstrikes causing further casualties. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Qatar have not yielded breakthroughs, and tensions remain high in both Gaza and the West Bank, where settler violence has increased.
