## Article summary
Police in New York's Nassau County are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who was injured after being pulled into an MRI machine. The incident occurred on Wednesday at Nassau Open MRI in Westbury, where the man, wearing a large metallic chain, was drawn into the machine, causing a medical episode. He later died from his injuries the following day. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that MRI machines create strong magnetic fields that can attract and pull on magnetic items, posing physical hazards. The FDA emphasizes the importance of careful screening to prevent such incidents.
