## Article summary
On Sunday, at least 94 Palestinians were killed by Israeli military fire across Gaza while seeking food aid, marking one of the deadliest days in recent months. The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, near the Israeli border area of Zikim, where 81 Palestinians died while trying to obtain flour from U.N. World Food Programme trucks. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that Israeli forces targeted civilians waiting for humanitarian aid, resulting in 95 injuries. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to remove an immediate threat and are examining the incident, noting discrepancies in the reported casualty numbers. The WFP condemned the violence, emphasizing the need for the protection of civilians and aid workers amid severe food shortages and widespread hunger in Gaza. Additionally, Israel announced new evacuations in central Gaza, urging residents to leave specific areas due to ongoing military operations. Pope Leo XIV mourned the deaths of three people sheltering at the Holy Family church in Gaza City and called for an immediate halt to the violence.
