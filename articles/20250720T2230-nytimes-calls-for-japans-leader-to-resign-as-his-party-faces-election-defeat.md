## Article summary
Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) faced a significant defeat in the Upper House elections, with exit polls indicating a shift in voter support towards opposition parties, including new right-wing populist groups. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's leadership has been criticized due to struggles with issues like rising rice prices, immigration backlash, and potential U.S. tariffs. Despite the poor showing, Ishiba expressed his intention to continue as leader, though analysts suggest he may struggle to maintain party support. The elections saw significant gains for two new nationalist parties, the Democratic Party for the People and Sanseito, which appealed to younger voters with populist policies. Voters expressed dissatisfaction with the LDP, citing rising prices and stagnant incomes as key concerns, while some supported the new parties' nationalist and anti-immigration stances.
