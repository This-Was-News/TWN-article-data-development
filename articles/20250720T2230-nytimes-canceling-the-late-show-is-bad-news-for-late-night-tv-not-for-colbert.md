## Article summary
The cancellation of "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert is seen as a setback for late-night television rather than for Colbert himself, who may benefit from the increased spotlight and opportunity to transition to his next act. Colbert's unique comedic style and political monologues made him a ratings leader, but his talents sometimes seemed constrained by the show's format. The cancellation, attributed to economic issues by CBS, has raised questions about the future of late-night television, which is facing challenges from the internet and increasing politicization. The decision to cancel the show, timed with a controversial settlement, has sparked concerns about the prioritization of financial and political interests over the integrity of late-night comedy. As audiences shift to online platforms, the future of network late-night television remains uncertain, with Colbert potentially finding a new home on digital platforms.
