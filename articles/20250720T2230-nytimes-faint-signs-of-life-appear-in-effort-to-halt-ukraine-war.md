## Article summary
The document discusses recent developments in the diplomatic efforts to halt the war in Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, facilitated by the Trump administration, have made little progress, with the main agreement being the exchange of bodies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has proposed renewed talks, including a cease-fire, prisoner exchanges, and the return of deported children, and has offered a direct meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has not directly responded to Ukraine's offer but has reiterated its desire for a peace agreement that achieves its war goals. The Trump administration has pushed for an unconditional cease-fire before substantive talks, and Ukraine has secured support for weapons agreements and potential sanctions on Russia's trading partners to pressure the Kremlin.
