## Article summary
The Trump administration is shutting down the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development, a key scientific research arm that provides expertise for environmental policies and regulations. The office analyzes various hazards, including toxic chemicals, climate change, and water pollution, and manages grant programs for universities and private companies. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the reduction in force is part of efforts to streamline the agency and save taxpayer dollars, while adding scientific experts to other offices. The cut is part of a broader plan to reduce the EPA's staff by 23%, saving $748.8 million, and includes the creation of a new "Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions." Critics, including Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Kyla Bennett of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, condemned the move, arguing it will cripple the EPA's research capabilities and negatively impact public health and safety. The American Chemistry Council expressed support for the EPA's evaluation of its resources to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars. The EPA has already reduced its workforce from 16,155 to 12,448 employees and eliminated other programs, including the Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion arms.
