## Article summary
The U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have severely impacted Lesotho's garment industry, leading to factory closures and job losses. Lesotho, known as Africa's denim hub, has around 35,000 garment workers facing an uncertain future. The tariffs, aimed at addressing a trade imbalance, have caused buyers to halt orders, despite being paused. The government declared a state of disaster to address the economic crisis, but the situation remains dire. Workers, many of whom are single mothers, are struggling to find employment and feed their families, with some blaming Trump for their plight. The industry's future is uncertain, with potential job losses affecting not just factory workers but also supporting businesses and services.
