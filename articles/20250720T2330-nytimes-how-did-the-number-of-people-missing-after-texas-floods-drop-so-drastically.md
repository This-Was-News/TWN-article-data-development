## Article summary
The number of people missing after the Texas floods dropped drastically from 97 to 3 in Kerr County, despite the death toll remaining unchanged. This fluctuation was due to the chaos following the disaster and the time-consuming process of verifying each missing person's status. Many initially reported as missing were either not victims of the flood or their status was misreported. Officials emphasized the importance of thorough investigation to ensure accurate reporting and support for affected families. Such drastic changes in missing persons numbers are not uncommon after major disasters, as seen in past events like the Paradise and Maui fires.
