## Article summary
After devastating floods in Texas Hill Country killed over 130 people, Texas lawmakers are convening a special legislative session to fund recovery efforts and enhance disaster preparedness. Key proposals include improving early warning systems, strengthening communication infrastructure, and providing relief funds for affected areas. Lawmakers are also considering stricter flood safety standards for youth camps and creating a flood disaster guide for volunteer organizations. The session is complicated by uncertainty surrounding the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as President Trump has proposed eliminating it, despite Texas relying on federal aid for disaster relief. Additionally, the session will address controversial topics such as redistricting, abortion laws, and regulations on hemp products, potentially extending the legislative agenda beyond flood-related issues.
