## Article summary
Harvard University is suing the Trump administration in federal court over the freeze of over $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, arguing that the move is illegal and threatens critical research. The administration froze the funds, alleging that Harvard violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by not addressing antisemitism on campus. Harvard's lawyers argue that the administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment, and that there is no connection between antisemitism concerns and the frozen research funds. The Trump administration claims Harvard failed to protect Jewish students and comply with federal law, justifying the funding freeze. The case, which is being closely watched by other universities, could have significant implications for federal control over higher education and may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
