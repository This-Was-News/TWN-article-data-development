## Article summary
The Trump administration is shutting down the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development, which provides scientific expertise for environmental policies and regulations. The closure is part of a broader plan to reduce the EPA's staff by 23%, saving $748.8 million. The agency claims it will reassign some employees and add scientific roles to other offices, while creating a new "Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions." Critics, including Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Kyla Bennett from Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, condemn the cuts, warning of severe impacts on public health and safety. The American Chemistry Council supports the EPA's evaluation of resources but emphasizes the importance of meeting statutory requirements efficiently. The EPA has already reduced its workforce from 16,155 to 12,448 employees and eliminated other programs, including Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives.
