## Article summary
Disabled Americans, including children like 10-year-old June Rice, rely on Medicaid's home- and community-based care services to live independently and avoid institutionalization. These services are at risk due to upcoming federal Medicaid spending cuts, despite assurances from the White House and congressional Republicans. Experts argue that states may struggle to offset the cuts solely by reducing hospital reimbursements, potentially leading to reductions in home care services. Cuts could manifest as restrictions on eligibility, reduced hours of care, lower pay for workers, or elimination of waiver programs, impacting the lives of millions of disabled Americans. Families and advocates express concern and frustration, emphasizing the profound impact these services have on their ability to live fulfilling, independent lives.
