## Article summary
Anthony Flynn's company, YouBar, has evolved from producing trend-driven snacks to specializing in protein-based products due to a surge in demand. Starting as a small operation making protein bars, YouBar now operates 24/7, producing a wide range of protein-infused foods for numerous brands. The company's personalized approach and innovation have attracted clients, leading to significant growth, with revenue increasing by 85% between 2022 and 2024. YouBar's role in the protein boom is substantial, as it manufactures products found in major retailers, though it remains largely unknown to individual consumers. Despite nutritional debates, YouBar continues to push boundaries in protein product development, with Anthony Flynn envisioning even more innovative and indulgent protein experiences.
