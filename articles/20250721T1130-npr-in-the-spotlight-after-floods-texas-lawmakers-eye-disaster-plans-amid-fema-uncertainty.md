## Article summary
Texas lawmakers are convening a special legislative session to address flood recovery and future disaster preparedness following recent devastating floods in the Hill Country that killed over 130 people. The session, initially planned for hemp regulation, now prioritizes flood-related issues, including improving early warning systems, strengthening infrastructure, and providing relief funds. Lawmakers will visit Kerrville, the hardest-hit area, to gather input from local officials and flood victims. The session also includes controversial GOP priorities such as redistricting and tightening abortion laws, which could extend the session's duration. The future of FEMA, which Texas relies on for disaster relief, is uncertain due to calls from the Trump administration to eliminate or reduce the agency, adding complexity to the state's disaster planning efforts.
