## Article summary
Harvard University is suing the Trump administration in federal court over the freeze of over $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, arguing that the move is illegal and threatens critical research. The administration froze the funds, alleging that Harvard violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by not addressing antisemitism on campus. Harvard contends that the administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment, and that there is no connection between antisemitism concerns and the frozen research funds. The Trump administration argues that Harvard failed to protect Jewish students and comply with federal law, justifying the funding freeze. The case, which supports over 900 research projects, including studies on Alzheimer's, cancer, and national security, is being closely watched by other institutions, with legal experts predicting a lengthy appeals process regardless of the outcome.
