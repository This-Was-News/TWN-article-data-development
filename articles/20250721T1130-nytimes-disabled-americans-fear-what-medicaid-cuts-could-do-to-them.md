## Article summary
The article discusses the fears of disabled Americans and their families regarding potential Medicaid cuts and the impact on home- and community-based care services. June Rice, a 10-year-old with rare diseases, relies on Medicaid for in-home nurses to live at home and attend school. About 4.5 million Americans depend on these services, including many older adults and children. The recent $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade has raised concerns about the future of these services. Experts argue that the cuts could force states to reduce home care, affecting the ability of disabled individuals to live independently and participate in their communities.
