## Article summary
The U.S. coffee industry is bracing for a 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee, the world's largest producer and source of about 30% of U.S. coffee imports. This tariff, along with others on coffee-producing countries like Vietnam and Colombia, is expected to significantly increase coffee prices for U.S. consumers and businesses. Small roasters like Lost Sock Roasters in Washington, D.C., are particularly concerned, as Brazilian beans are crucial for their blends. The tariffs, set to begin on August 1, are defended by the Trump administration as a means to protect American jobs and renegotiate trade deals, but business owners argue that the U.S. does not produce coffee at the scale needed to offset the impact. The price increases will likely be felt first by regular consumers buying coffee at supermarkets, while businesses with stockpiled coffee may have a few months before the effects are noticed.
