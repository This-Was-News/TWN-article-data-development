## Article summary
The author explores the complexities and frustrations of modern heterosexual dating, highlighting the anxiety and ambivalence often exhibited by men. She describes encounters with men who initially express interest but then withdraw due to anxiety or confusion, leaving her feeling disappointed and confused. The text discusses the concept of "heterofatalism," a term describing the pessimism many straight women feel about dating men, and questions whether this perspective is productive or merely perpetuates a cycle of disappointment. The author reflects on the emotional labor and hermeneutic labor women often perform in relationships, interpreting male behavior and managing emotional entanglements. Ultimately, she grapples with the tension between desire and disillusionment, wondering if the old-fashioned dynamics of heterosexual relationships can ever be transcended or if a new, more equitable model of intimacy is needed.
