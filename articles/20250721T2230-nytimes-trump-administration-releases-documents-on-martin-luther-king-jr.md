## Article summary
The Trump administration released approximately a quarter-million pages of documents related to the investigation into the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as per President Trump's executive order. The documents include investigative notes, interviews, and details of interactions with foreign intelligence services during the manhunt for the assassin, James Earl Ray. The King family expressed concerns about the release, fearing it could focus on Dr. King's personal life and potentially feed a negative revisionist view of him. The family requested that the material be viewed in the context of Dr. King's contributions to society and asked for empathy and respect for their continuing grief. The release comes amidst the administration's reversal on releasing more files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation and follows a Justice Department move to unseal F.B.I. surveillance records in the King case.
