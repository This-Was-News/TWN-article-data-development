## Article summary
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), led by Tulsi Gabbard, has released a report claiming that the Obama administration "manufactured and politicized intelligence" to target President Trump. The report includes declassified emails and memos suggesting that Obama officials were aware of Russian election interference but did not believe it directly manipulated vote counts. Gabbard argues that these findings contradict the 2017 intelligence assessment that Russia attempted to influence the election. Democrats, including Rep. Jim Himes and Sen. Mark Warner, have criticized the report as politically motivated and contradictory to previous reviews. Meanwhile, CIA Director John Ratcliffe also released a report alleging manipulation of intelligence by Obama officials, but it does not directly contradict the 2017 assessment's central thesis.
