## Article summary
A federal judge in Kentucky sentenced former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison to nearly three years in prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during a botched 2020 drug raid. Hankison, who is white, was convicted of using excessive force by firing multiple shots through Taylor's window, though none hit her. The sentence was a rebuke to the Trump administration, which had requested only one day in prison. The case became a symbol of national outrage over police violence against Black people, alongside the murder of George Floyd. Protests occurred outside the courthouse before the sentencing, reflecting the lingering anger over Taylor's death and the administration's lenient sentencing request.
