## Article summary
The Trump administration released over 6,000 documents related to the investigation of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, totaling nearly 250,000 pages, without prior public notice. The documents include investigative notes, interviews, and details of interactions with foreign intelligence services during the manhunt for James Earl Ray, King's killer. Some documents contain sensitive information about King's personal life, raising concerns from his family about potential harm to his reputation. The King family requested that the public approach the documents with empathy and respect for their continuing grief. The release comes amid the administration's efforts to divert attention from criticism over withholding files related to Jeffrey Epstein's death.
