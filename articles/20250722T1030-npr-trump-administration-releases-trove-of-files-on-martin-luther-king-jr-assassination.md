## Article summary
The Trump administration released thousands of digitized documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., following an executive order by President Trump. The release includes over 230,000 files, detailing the FBI's investigation, potential leads, and information about James Earl Ray, the convicted assassin. King's family responded by emphasizing the need to view the files within their historical context, noting that King was heavily surveilled by the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. The family also reiterated their long-standing dispute of Ray's conviction, suggesting he was set up. The release comes amid pressure on the administration to disclose additional information related to Jeffrey Epstein, following a previous release of JFK assassination records in March.
