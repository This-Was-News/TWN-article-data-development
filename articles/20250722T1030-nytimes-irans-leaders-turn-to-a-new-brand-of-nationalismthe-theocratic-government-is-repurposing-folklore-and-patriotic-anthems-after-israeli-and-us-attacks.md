## Article summary
Iran's leaders are leveraging nationalist sentiment following recent attacks by Israel and the U.S. to unite the country and bolster their government's standing amidst economic and political challenges. This has led to a fusion of Shiite identity and Iranian nationalism, with the government embracing ancient folklore and patriotic symbols previously associated with secular nationalists. The war has seemingly delayed anticipated domestic turmoil and increased public tolerance for government restrictions, including internet access limitations and crackdowns on dissent. Critics argue that the newfound nationalism is driven by anger over foreign attacks rather than genuine support for the government. While some see this as an authentic expression of patriotism, others view it as engineered nationalism that may not have lasting effects once the immediate crisis passes.
