## Article summary
The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reassigned some field office employees to reduce wait times for its national 800 phone number, but this has increased workload and stress for remaining staff. Experts argue that the SSA's staffing shortages, exacerbated by recent resignations, make it difficult to balance phone services with other critical tasks. While the SSA reports improved phone service, frontline workers say the reassignments have harmed public services, particularly for benefit applications. The agency has removed real-time metrics from its website, making it harder to assess overall performance. Workers and policy experts agree that hiring more staff is essential to address the ongoing challenges effectively.
