## Article summary
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is planning to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana, as well as expand detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the use of these bases, requested by DHS, through September 30, 2025. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will manage the care and handling of migrants at these locations. The Trump administration has been pushing to increase the detention of immigrants without legal status, with DHS currently holding nearly 57,000 people in immigration detention. The use of these military bases for immigration detention has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers, who argue it jeopardizes military preparedness and is an inappropriate use of military resources.
