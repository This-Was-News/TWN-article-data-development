## Article summary
In Virginia, university presidents are facing attacks from conservative groups and the Trump administration, with the latest target being George Mason University's president, Gregory N. Washington. The attacks are part of a broader effort by Governor Glenn Youngkin to reshape Virginia's higher education system, with his appointees to university boards pushing to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.) initiatives. George Mason University, despite its conservative ties, has been scrutinized for its D.E.I. programs, with the Heritage Foundation and the university's board accusing it of promoting radical left-wing ideologies. The university's president, Dr. Washington, has faced criticism for his support of D.E.I. initiatives and for permitting pro-Palestinian protests that some Jewish students and faculty found offensive. Supporters of Dr. Washington have criticized the university's board and the federal investigations into antisemitism and D.E.I. violations, arguing that they are politically motivated and aimed at controlling the university's ideology.
