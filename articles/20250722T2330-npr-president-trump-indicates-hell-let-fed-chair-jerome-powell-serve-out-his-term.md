## Article summary
President Trump has indicated he will allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out his term, which ends in May 2026, despite recent criticisms. Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, though he has not ruled out firing him. The Fed has kept interest rates steady this year due to inflation concerns sparked by Trump's tariffs, with a rate cut unlikely at the next meeting. Top officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have criticized Powell's leadership and the Fed's renovation project, which has seen significant cost overruns. Powell has defended the Fed's actions and initiated a review of the renovation project to address complaints.
