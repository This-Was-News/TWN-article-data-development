## Article summary
The Justice Department is arranging a meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's associate, to gather information about the Epstein case. President Trump, a former friend of Epstein, dismissed the ongoing Epstein controversy as a "witch hunt" and claimed to know little about the recent developments. During a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Trump announced a 19% tariff on imports from the Philippines while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent much of the time criticizing former President Barack Obama and Democratic figures, referencing claims made by his spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, about alleged intelligence manipulation regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. Obama's office responded by calling Trump's statements "outrageous" and a weak attempt at distraction, while Republicans in Congress have been dealing with internal conflicts over the Epstein issue, leading to an early recess.
