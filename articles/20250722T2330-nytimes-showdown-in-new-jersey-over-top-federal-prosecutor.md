## Article summary
A power struggle erupted in New Jersey's U.S. attorney's office after federal judges appointed Desiree Leigh Grace as the new U.S. attorney, rejecting Alina Habba's bid to stay. The Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, strongly opposed the judges' decision, accusing them of overstepping their authority. Grace, an experienced prosecutor, was fired by the Justice Department shortly after her appointment, raising questions about the enforcement of the judges' decision. The conflict highlights tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary, with the president asserting control over the Justice Department. Habba, Trump's former personal lawyer, faces opposition from New Jersey's Democratic senators over her prosecutorial actions and lack of experience in criminal law.
