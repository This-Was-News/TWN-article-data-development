## Article summary
Tom Mullaney, a professor of Chinese history at Stanford University, has spent years searching for and collecting Chinese typewriters, which are increasingly rare and hold historical significance. One typewriter, the MingKwai, invented by Lin Yutang in the 1930s, was particularly elusive, with only one prototype ever made and its whereabouts unknown for decades. The MingKwai's innovative design allowed for typing thousands of Chinese characters using just 72 keys, but it was deemed a failure after a malfunction during a demonstration and subsequently disappeared. In early 2025, the MingKwai was discovered in a storage box in New York by Jennifer and Nelson Felix, who posted photos online, leading to its identification by Mullaney and the typewriter community. The Felixes sold the MingKwai to Stanford University Libraries, where Mullaney hopes to study its intricate machinery and gain insights into Lin Yutang's vision and the history of Chinese typewriters.
