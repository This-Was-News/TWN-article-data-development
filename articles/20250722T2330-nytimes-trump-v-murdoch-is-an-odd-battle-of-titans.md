## Article summary
President Trump retaliated against The Wall Street Journal by excluding it from his press pool, following an article about his past ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Simultaneously, Fox News hosts praised Trump's potential second term, highlighting the network's continued support for him. Trump's lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, owner of The Wall Street Journal, marks a significant clash between two media titans. However, both Trump and Murdoch are constrained by their need to appeal to conservative Americans, Fox News' primary audience. Fox News has largely avoided discussing The Journal's scoop or Trump's lawsuit, reflecting its loyalty to Trump and its conservative viewership.
