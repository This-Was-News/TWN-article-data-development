## Article summary
China now dominates the rare earth elements industry, controlling refining and supply chains crucial for electronics and defense systems. This dominance has given China leverage in trade disputes, such as the one with the United States, where access to rare earths was a key issue. China's rise to dominance involved decades of trial and error, including unregulated mining that caused significant environmental damage and led to government intervention. The Chinese government consolidated the industry into six state-controlled companies, ensuring control over supply and pricing. Meanwhile, U.S. companies face challenges in re-entering the market due to investment hesitancy and China's market influence, though recent disruptions have sparked renewed interest and investment in American rare earth ventures.
