## Article summary
The effectiveness of precooling homes during off-peak hours varies, with some experts and power companies endorsing the practice while others caution against it. Precooling involves significantly lowering home temperatures during off-peak hours to maintain comfort during peak hours, potentially saving energy and costs. However, it can be energy-intensive and produce greenhouse gases if not done properly, according to researchers like Daniel Barber. Power companies have differing opinions, with some recommending precooling strategies and others advising against it due to potential increased costs and system strain. Additional energy-saving tips include regular air filter changes, sealing drafts, using appliances during off-peak hours, and keeping curtains closed during peak hours.
