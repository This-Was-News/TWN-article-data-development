## Article summary
As the United States withdraws from UNESCO under President Trump's administration, China is expanding its influence within the organization. China has increased its financial contributions and political involvement, with a Chinese official now serving as UNESCO's deputy director general. UNESCO has supported China's priorities, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the designation of World Heritage sites, some of which are in oppressed regions like Tibet and Xinjiang. China's influence extends to artificial intelligence guidelines, with UNESCO partnering with a major Chinese A.I. company. The U.S. retreat from international institutions like UNESCO provides an opportunity for China to advance its soft power and cultural influence globally.
