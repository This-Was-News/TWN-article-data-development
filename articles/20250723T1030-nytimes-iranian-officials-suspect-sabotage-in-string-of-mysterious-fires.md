## Article summary
Iran has experienced a series of unexplained fires and explosions over the past two weeks, affecting various locations including apartment complexes, oil refineries, and a shoe factory. While Iranian officials publicly attribute these incidents to coincidences or aging infrastructure, privately, some officials, including a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, suspect sabotage. They suspect Israel, citing its history of covert operations in Iran and recent threats following a 12-day bombing campaign. A European official also assessed the attacks as sabotage, pointing to Israel's history of psychological warfare and targeted operations in Iran. Despite these suspicions, no concrete evidence has been provided, and public explanations for the incidents remain unconvincing.
