## Article summary
General Motors reported that tariffs cost the company approximately $1.1 billion in the last quarter, reducing its profit margin from 9% to 6.1%. The company aims to offset at least 30% of the expected $4 to $5 billion tariff impact for 2025 through manufacturing changes, cost initiatives, and consumer pricing. Despite a 25% tariff, GM continues to import vehicles from Korea due to high demand. GM's stock dropped 6% after the earnings reveal, indicating investor dissatisfaction with the company's strategy of absorbing tariffs. Industry-wide, car manufacturers have largely absorbed higher tariffs, with only a modest increase in vehicle prices passed on to consumers.
