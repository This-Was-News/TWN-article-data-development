## Article summary
China has established a near-monopoly on the refining of rare earth elements, which are crucial for electronics and defense systems. The country's dominance has given it significant leverage in trade negotiations, as demonstrated by recent supply chain controls that disrupted U.S. and European production. China's rise to dominance involved decades of trial and error, including unregulated mining that caused severe environmental damage. The Chinese government eventually consolidated the industry into six state-controlled firms, known as the Big Six, to control supply and price. Despite challenges, some U.S. companies are attempting to re-enter the rare earth market, with recent disruptions in Chinese exports sparking renewed investor interest.
