## Article summary
As heat waves and extreme temperatures sweep across the U.S., many are turning to "precooling" their homes during off-peak hours to save energy and reduce costs. Precooling involves significantly lowering the home's temperature at night and maintaining that coolness during peak hours. However, its effectiveness varies, with experts and power companies offering differing opinions. Daniel Barber, a professor of architecture, suggests that precooling can be energy-intensive and produce greenhouse gases, but it can be effective if the air conditioning system is well-maintained and windows are kept closed. Other energy-saving tips include using fans to concentrate cool air, sealing drafts, using appliances during off-peak hours, and keeping curtains closed during peak hours.
