## Article summary
The article discusses China's increasing influence at UNESCO following the United States' withdrawal under President Trump's administration. China has become a major funder and player in UNESCO, supporting initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and lobbying for World Heritage designations, including in contested regions like Tibet and Xinjiang. The U.S. retreat from UNESCO and other international bodies has allowed China to expand its soft power and cultural influence. Critics argue that China uses UNESCO to appropriate and control the culture and history of persecuted ethnic minorities. The article also highlights incidents like the cancellation of a Uyghur linguist's presentation at a UNESCO conference, suggesting China's influence and censorship within the organization.
