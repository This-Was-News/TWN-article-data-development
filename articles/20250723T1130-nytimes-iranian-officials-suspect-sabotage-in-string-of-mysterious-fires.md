## Article summary
For over two weeks, Iran has experienced a series of unexplained fires and explosions, including at strategic sites like oil refineries and apartment buildings. While publicly attributing these incidents to gas leaks and aging infrastructure, Iranian officials privately suspect sabotage, with Israel being the primary suspect due to its history of covert operations in Iran. The explosions have fueled public anxiety and speculation, with some Iranians believing the recent war with Israel has not truly ended. Israeli officials have declined to comment, but Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad, has indicated it will continue operations in Iran. The Iranian government's lack of transparency and vague explanations have deepened public fear and suspicion, with many questioning the circumstances surrounding recent events, including the death of a high-ranking military official.
