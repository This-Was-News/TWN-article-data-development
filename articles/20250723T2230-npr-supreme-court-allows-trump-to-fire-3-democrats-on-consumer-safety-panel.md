## Article summary
The Supreme Court ruled that President Trump could fire three Democratic appointees to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) without cause, limiting a 90-year-old precedent protecting the independence of regulatory agencies. The decision challenges the longstanding precedent of *Humphrey's Executor*, which restricts presidential power to remove agency officials except for misconduct. Biden had appointed the three commissioners in 2021, but Trump fired them shortly after taking office, arguing he had the authority to do so as the nation's chief executive. The commissioners sued, asserting their positions were protected by law, but the Supreme Court ultimately sided with the Trump administration. This ruling follows a previous decision allowing the termination of members from other regulatory boards, further consolidating executive power over independent agencies.
