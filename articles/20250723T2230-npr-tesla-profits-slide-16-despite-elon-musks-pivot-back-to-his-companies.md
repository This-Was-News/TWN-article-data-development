## Article summary
Tesla reported a 16% drop in profits for the second quarter of 2025, despite CEO Elon Musk's renewed focus on his companies. The decline follows a 13.5% drop in electric vehicle sales compared to the same period last year. Tesla highlighted its expansion into AI, robotics, and related services, including the launch of its robotaxi service in Austin and the development of a humanoid robot called Optimus. The company's automotive revenue slipped 16%, while energy generation and storage revenue decreased by 7%, though services and other revenue grew by 17%. Tesla's market share in the U.S. has declined to 46.2% from nearly 80%, facing increased competition from traditional automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers. Additionally, Tesla has experienced high executive turnover, with three senior leaders leaving in the last two months, and delayed its annual shareholder meeting, raising concerns among investors.
