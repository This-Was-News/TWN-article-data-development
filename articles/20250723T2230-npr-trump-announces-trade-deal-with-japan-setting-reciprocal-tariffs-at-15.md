## Article summary
President Trump announced a trade deal with Japan, setting "reciprocal" tariffs at 15%, which he described as a "massive Deal" that will see Japan invest $550 billion in the U.S. The agreement aims to open Japan's market to U.S. cars, trucks, rice, and other agricultural products, potentially creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged the deal, stating it would benefit both sides, despite earlier threats of higher tariffs from Trump. The U.S. had a nearly $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan in 2024, and the new tariff rate is lower than previously threatened rates of 24% and 25%. The deal includes Japan's commitment to buying 100 Boeing aircraft and lifting restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese market.
