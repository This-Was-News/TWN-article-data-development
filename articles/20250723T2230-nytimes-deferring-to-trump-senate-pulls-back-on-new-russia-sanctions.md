## Article summary
The Senate has paused a bipartisan effort to impose new sanctions on Russia due to President Trump's threat to penalize Russia if it does not reach a cease-fire with Ukraine. The legislation, backed by 85 senators, aimed to impose harsh sanctions on countries doing business with Russia, but Republican leaders have deferred to Trump's unilateral approach. Trump has proposed a 100% tariff on Russia and its trading partners if Putin does not agree to a cease-fire within 50 days, though analysts doubt his commitment. Senators like Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal support Trump's timeline but believe their legislation would impose more punishing penalties. The pause in congressional action has raised questions, especially amid recent deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine, but most Republicans view Trump's pivot on Russia as progress.
