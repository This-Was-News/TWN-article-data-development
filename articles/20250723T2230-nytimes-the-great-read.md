## Article summary
The Delacorte Theater in Central Park has undergone an $85 million renovation, reopening with a production of Twelfth Night. The theater, originally built in 1962, was in dire need of repairs, with issues like leaking water, raccoon infestations, and cramped seating. The renovation, led by architect Stephen Chu, has modernized the theater while preserving its rustic charm and egalitarian spirit. The upgrades include wider seats, improved wheelchair access, and better backstage facilities, allowing for more performances each summer. The theater's history reflects the evolving landscape of Central Park and the city's commitment to providing free, accessible culture to all.
