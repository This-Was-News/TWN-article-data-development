## Article summary
The release of previously classified files on Martin Luther King Jr. by the Trump administration has reignited debates about his legacy and the way his image and message have been used politically. Throughout history, political figures have selectively engaged with or distorted King's narrative to serve their own purposes, from JFK's intervention in his arrest to Nixon's portrayal of him as a lawbreaker. The recent disclosure, which did not reveal significant new information, was eagerly anticipated by those seeking evidence of conspiracy in King's assassination or flaws in his character. King's daughter, Bernice King, noted that a 1967 poll showed he was one of the most hated men in America, suggesting that many who invoke him today might not truly embrace his authentic message. Historian Dr. John Kirk emphasizes that King's legacy has always been a malleable narrative, reshaped by various political forces to suit their ideological goals.
