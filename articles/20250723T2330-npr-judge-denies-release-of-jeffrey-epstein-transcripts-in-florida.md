## Article summary
A Florida federal judge has denied a request to unseal grand jury transcripts from a federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, citing that 11th Circuit law does not permit her to grant the government's request. The Department of Justice had asked for the release of the transcripts, claiming public interest, but the judge ruled that the request did not fall under the limited exceptions allowed under law. The ruling comes amid political controversy, with President Trump and lawmakers facing pressure to release more information about Epstein's case. House Speaker Mike Johnson has canceled votes and sent lawmakers home early due to clashes over the Epstein files. Additionally, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a subpoena to Ghislaine Maxwell for a deposition from federal prison.
