## Article summary
The Supreme Court ruled that President Trump could fire three Democrats appointed by President Biden to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) without cause. This decision weakens a 90-year-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which aimed to protect the independence of regulatory agencies by limiting the president's power to remove officials. The 1935 precedent had prevented President Roosevelt from firing an FTC commissioner who disagreed with his New Deal plan. Biden's appointees to the CPSC, which sets product safety standards, sued after Trump fired them, arguing that Congress designed the agency to be independent and that the president could only remove them for misconduct. The Supreme Court's decision, while temporary, aligns with a previous ruling that allowed Trump to terminate members of other regulatory boards, further limiting the independence of such agencies.
