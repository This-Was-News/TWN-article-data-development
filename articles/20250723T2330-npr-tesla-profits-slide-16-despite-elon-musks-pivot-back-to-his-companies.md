## Article summary
Tesla reported a 16% drop in profits for the second quarter of 2025, despite CEO Elon Musk's renewed focus on his companies. The decline follows a challenging period marked by a 13.5% decrease in electric vehicle sales compared to the same period last year. Tesla's net income also fell by 16% year-on-year, though this was an improvement compared to the 71% drop in the first quarter. The company highlighted its expansion into AI, robotics, and related services, including the launch of its robotaxi service in Austin and the development of a humanoid robot called Optimus. Tesla's total automotive revenue slipped by 16%, while energy generation and storage revenue decreased by 7%, though services and other revenue grew by 17%. The company faces increased competition in the EV market, both domestically and globally, with traditional automakers and Chinese EV makers gaining market share. Additionally, Tesla has experienced high executive turnover and concerns from investors over the delay of its annual shareholder meeting, which was pushed back to November.
