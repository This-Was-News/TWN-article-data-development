## Article summary
The Delacorte Theater in Central Park, known for its free Shakespeare productions, has undergone an $85 million renovation and will reopen with a production of Twelfth Night. The theater, originally built in 1962, was in dire need of repairs, with issues like water leaks, raccoon infestations, and inadequate facilities. The renovation, led by architect Stephen Chu, has modernized the theater while preserving its rustic charm, including the use of reclaimed redwood from decommissioned city water towers. The upgrades include improved seating, better wheelchair access, and enhanced backstage facilities, allowing for more performances each summer. The theater's history reflects the park's evolution and the city's commitment to providing free, accessible culture, as exemplified by its founder, Joseph Papp.
