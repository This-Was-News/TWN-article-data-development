## Article summary
The release of Martin Luther King Jr.'s files by the Trump administration has reignited debates about his legacy, with political figures historically using and distorting his narrative for their own purposes. Kings legacy has been shaped by both the right and the left, with conservatives often depoliticizing him and progressives sometimes oversimplifying his message. The selective interpretation of Kings words, such as his "I Have a Dream" speech, has been used to argue against race-conscious policies, distorting his views on race. The establishment of Martin Luther King Jr. Day by President Reagan marked a shift in conservative engagement with Kings legacy, leading to efforts to make him more palatable to the right. Despite the release of new documents, Kings legacy continues to be used as a political tool, with the public often engaging with a sanitized version of his message that lacks the urgency and fight he demanded.
