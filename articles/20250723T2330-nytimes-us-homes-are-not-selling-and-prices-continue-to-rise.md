## Article summary
The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradox where home prices continue to rise despite a decline in sales. In June, home sales dropped by 2.7% from the previous month, while the median home price reached a record high of $435,300. High mortgage rates and a lack of available homes are contributing to an affordability crisis, with about 15% of June deals falling through. The market is characterized by low inventory, as homeowners with low mortgage rates are reluctant to sell, and sellers are holding out for higher prices. However, there are signs of a shift, with inventory up 16% from June 2024 and homes taking longer to sell, though affordability challenges persist.
