## Article summary
A Florida federal judge has denied a request to unseal grand jury transcripts from a Jeffrey Epstein case, citing legal constraints. The Department of Justice had sought the release, arguing public interest, but the judge ruled it didn't meet legal exceptions. The ruling comes amid political controversy, with President Trump and lawmakers facing pressure to disclose more information about Epstein's case. House Speaker Mike Johnson canceled votes and sent lawmakers home early to avoid a vote on the Epstein files. Meanwhile, a House Oversight panel voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its Epstein investigation files, and a subpoena was issued for Ghislaine Maxwell's deposition.
