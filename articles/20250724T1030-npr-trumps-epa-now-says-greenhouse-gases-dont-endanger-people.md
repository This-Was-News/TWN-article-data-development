## Article summary
The Trump administration's EPA has proposed overturning a 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, a move that could significantly roll back U.S. climate policies. The proposal, currently under White House review, aims to revoke the legal foundation for regulations on climate pollution from power plants, vehicles, and the oil and gas industry. Environmentalists warn this could undermine efforts to address climate change, while the administration frames it as a deregulatory win for the economy. The move follows record-breaking global temperatures, climate-fueled disasters, and Trump's broader push to prioritize fossil fuels over Biden's climate agenda. Legal battles and public comment periods could delay or block the proposal, but if upheld, it would hinder future efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
