## Article summary
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Trump, overhauls the federal student loan system, affecting nearly 43 million borrowers. The Biden-era SAVE plan is ending, and borrowers will see interest accrue on their loans starting August 1, with a deadline to switch plans by July 1, 2028. New borrowing limits will be imposed from July 1, 2026, reducing loan amounts for graduate students and parents. Repayment options are changing to two new plans: the standard plan with fixed payments over 10-25 years, and the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) based on income, with a minimum $10 monthly payment. RAP offers interest waivers and principal reductions, but loan forgiveness is extended to 30 years, and current borrowers can also access the older Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan.
