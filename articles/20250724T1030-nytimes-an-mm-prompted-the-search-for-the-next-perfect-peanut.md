## Article summary
The search for the perfect peanut began when Mars, Inc. faced complaints about rancid peanuts in their M&Ms. Researchers at the University of Georgia developed the Georgia-09B peanut, which met Mars' criteria for taste, texture, and growth. With a $3.5 million investment from Mars, the Wild Peanut Lab is now focused on creating peanuts resilient to climate change, diseases, and pests. The lab's work aims to increase peanut yield and reduce crop losses, benefiting farmers globally. Mars' open-source approach to agricultural research ensures that the benefits of their investments are widely shared, aligning with the company's principle of mutuality.
