Kenyon uses this misreading to create a playful tension between unease and reassurance, ultimately highlighting the inevitability of death. The poem's final stanza bluntly confronts mortality, with a touch of dark humor. The author also provides background on Kenyon, noting her struggles with depression and her untimely death from leukemia at age 47, emphasizing the theme of mortality in her work.
