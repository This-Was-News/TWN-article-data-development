## Article summary
The Trump administration's EPA is proposing to revoke a 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, which has been the foundation for numerous climate regulations. This move aims to overturn key climate policies and could significantly impact efforts to address climate change. The proposal is currently under White House review and faces potential legal challenges. Environmentalists argue that the move prioritizes fossil fuel interests over public health and scientific consensus. If upheld, the decision would hinder future administrations' ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
