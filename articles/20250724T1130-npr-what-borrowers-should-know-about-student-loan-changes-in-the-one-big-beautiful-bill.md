## Article summary
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Trump, overhauls the federal student loan system, impacting nearly 43 million borrowers. The Biden-era SAVE plan is being phased out, with interest accruing again for its 7.7 million borrowers starting August 1, and borrowers must switch plans by July 1, 2028. New borrowing limits will take effect on July 1, 2026, capping graduate student loans at $20,500 annually and parent PLUS loans at $20,000 annually. Repayment options are reduced to two plans: the standard plan with fixed payments over 10-25 years, and the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which bases payments on income and offers interest waivers and principal reductions. RAP extends loan forgiveness to 30 years, and current borrowers can also access the older Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, though loan forgiveness processing is temporarily halted due to legal actions.
