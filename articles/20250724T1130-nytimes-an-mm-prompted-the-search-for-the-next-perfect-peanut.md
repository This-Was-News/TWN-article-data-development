## Article summary
The search for the perfect peanut began when Mars, the company behind M&Ms, faced complaints about rancid peanuts in the early 2000s. They sought a peanut that was healthy, symmetrical, and had the right flavor and texture for their candies. Researchers at the University of Georgia developed the Georgia-09B peanut, which met all of Mars' requirements and significantly reduced customer complaints. Now, with funding from Mars, scientists at the Wild Peanut Lab are working to create peanuts that can withstand climate change, diseases, and pests. The goal is to increase peanut yield, reduce crop losses, and support farmers globally, with the ultimate aim of ensuring a steady supply of high-quality peanuts for Mars' products.
