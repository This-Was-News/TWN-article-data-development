## Article summary
Lawmakers are facing pressure to release Department of Justice files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein's investigation as they return to their districts. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-Pa.) supports releasing the files if the White House does not act, emphasizing the need for transparency. President Trump has faced criticism from his supporters who distrust the DOJ's findings and Epstein's death investigation. Some Republican lawmakers, including Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Eli Crane (R-Ariz.), have backed efforts to release the records, despite internal GOP divisions. The issue has become a political liability for Republicans, with Democratic groups highlighting the GOP's internal strife over the Epstein saga.
