## Article summary
President Trump visited the Federal Reserve to inspect renovations and publicly disagreed with Fed Chair Jerome Powell about the project's cost, with Trump claiming it had reached $3.1 billion and Powell disputing this figure. The renovation's cost has increased from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion, becoming a point of contention as Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump's visit was unusual, as presidents typically avoid interfering with the Fed's independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, even threatening to fire him, but Powell has stated he intends to serve out his term. The Fed's recent interest rate decisions have been influenced by concerns about inflation, making a rate cut unlikely at the next policy meeting.
