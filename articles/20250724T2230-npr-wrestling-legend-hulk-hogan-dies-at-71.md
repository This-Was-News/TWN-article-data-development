## Article summary
Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, has passed away at the age of 71 due to a cardiac arrest. He was a prominent figure in professional wrestling, particularly during the 1980s, and was a key figure in the rise of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Hogan's popularity was so immense that it was dubbed "Hulkamania," and he even ventured into acting, including a notable role in "Rocky III." In recent years, he became associated with right-wing politics, making an appearance at the 2024 Republican National Convention. Hogan also gained media attention for his lawsuit against Gawker Media, which resulted in a $140 million award and the company's bankruptcy.
