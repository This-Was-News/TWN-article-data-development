## Article summary
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the merger between Paramount and Skydance, a highly scrutinized media deal. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr endorsed the deal after Skydance committed to unbiased journalism and avoiding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The merger marks a shift in Paramount's leadership, with David Ellison, son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison, set to take control. Recent controversies include Paramount's $16 million settlement with former President Trump and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, which some Democrats allege was politically motivated. Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna M. Gomez criticized the approval, arguing it imposes unprecedented controls on newsroom decisions and violates press freedom.
