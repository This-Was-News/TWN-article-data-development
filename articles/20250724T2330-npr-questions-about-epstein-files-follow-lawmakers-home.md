## Article summary
As lawmakers head home for a recess, many are facing calls for transparency regarding the Department of Justice's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Republican Rep. Ryan Mackenzie of Pennsylvania, during a town hall, expressed support for releasing the DOJ files on Epstein if the White House does not act. President Trump has recently faced criticism from his supporters who distrust the DOJ's conclusions about Epstein's "client list" and his death in 2019. Democratic groups are targeting Republican lawmakers, seeing the Epstein saga as a political liability and a divisive issue within the GOP. Republican strategist Rina Shah noted that the push for transparency on Epstein could reshape the party, with a potential House vote in September being a defining moment for the GOP.
