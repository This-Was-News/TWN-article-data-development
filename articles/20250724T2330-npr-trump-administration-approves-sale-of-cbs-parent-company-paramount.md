## Article summary
The Trump administration, through the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), approved the $8 billion sale of Paramount Global to Skydance Media. This approval came after Paramount and the Ellison family took steps to address concerns raised by the Trump administration regarding CBS's news coverage. Key concessions included canceling "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," eliminating U.S.-based Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, and creating an ombudsman to address complaints of ideological bias. Additionally, Paramount settled a lawsuit filed by Trump for $16 million. FCC Chair Brendan Carr praised these changes, stating they exposed partisan biases in media and were a result of Trump's influence.
