## Article summary
President Trump visited the Federal Reserve to inspect renovations and publicly disagreed with Fed Chair Jerome Powell about the project's cost, with Trump claiming it had reached $3.1 billion and Powell disputing the figure. The renovation's cost has risen from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion, becoming a point of contention as Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. Trump's visit was unusual, as presidents typically avoid interfering with the Fed's independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, even threatening to fire him, but Powell has stated he intends to complete his term. The Fed's recent interest rate decisions and inflation concerns make it unlikely they will cut rates soon, despite Trump's pressure.
