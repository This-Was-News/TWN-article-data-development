## Article summary
Hulk Hogan made a notable appearance at the Republican National Convention, where he tore off his shirt to reveal a Trump/Vance tank top. His speech was a show of support for Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Hogan referenced a recent event where he believed Trump was unfairly attacked and declared, "Enough was enough." He encouraged the crowd to embrace "Trumpamania," urging it to "run wild" and "rule again." The stunt was a dramatic display of enthusiasm for the Trump-Vance ticket.
