## Article summary
President Trump has struggled to manage the ongoing scrutiny surrounding the Epstein files, employing various strategies to deflect and distract from the story. Despite his efforts, including social media outbursts and legal actions against media outlets, public dissatisfaction remains high, with polls showing that many, including his base, are unhappy with the administration's handling of the situation. The Epstein files have sparked calls for transparency from all three branches of government, with Trump arguing that releasing the files may not quell conspiracies. Recent developments include the Justice Department interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell and attempts to release grand jury transcripts, though these efforts have faced legal hurdles. The controversy has also highlighted Trump's complex relationship with the Epstein case, with reports indicating he was aware of his name appearing in the files as early as May. Despite the challenges, Trump's approval among Republicans remains stable, though the issue continues to pose political risks, particularly for swing-district Republicans.
