## Article summary
President Trump has issued an executive order targeting college sports, aiming to ban "pay-for-play" deals and mandate scholarships for women's and Olympic sports. The order empowers federal agencies, including the Department of Education, to enforce these provisions and threatens to withhold federal funds from non-compliant schools. It also seeks to limit lucrative name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals for athletes, which have transformed athlete compensation in recent years. Legal experts question the order's legality, but it signals increased federal interest in college sports. The order comes after a recent settlement allowing Division I schools to pay athletes directly, raising concerns about the future of non-revenue sports.
