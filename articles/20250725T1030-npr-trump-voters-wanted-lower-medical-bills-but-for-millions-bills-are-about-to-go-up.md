## Article summary
President Trump's healthcare policies are expected to increase medical bills for millions of Americans, pushing more into debt and straining family budgets. The recent tax cut legislation is projected to leave 10 million more people uninsured by 2034, reducing protections against high medical costs. Significant increases in health plan premiums and changes to federal rules, such as COVID-19 vaccine coverage and Medicaid copays, will further raise out-of-pocket expenses. The rollback of regulations that would have removed medical debt from credit reports puts Americans at risk of lower credit scores and higher interest rates. Consumer and patient advocates warn that these changes will undermine financial security, making it harder for families to manage medical debt and access essential services.
