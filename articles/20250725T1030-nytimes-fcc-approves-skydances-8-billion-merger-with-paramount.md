## Article summary
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved Skydance's $8 billion merger with Paramount, marking a significant media deal. The approval came with assurances from Skydance to commit to unbiased journalism and avoid diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The merger, initially announced in July, faced scrutiny and delays, including a $16 million settlement with President Trump over a lawsuit involving CBS's 60 Minutes. The deal's closure is expected soon, with David Ellison, son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison, set to take control of Paramount. The merger has raised concerns about the future of Paramount's management team, workforce, and popular programs, with some disputes over content and corporate interference already surfacing.
