## Article summary
The New York Sign Museum, founded by David Barnett and Mac Pohanka, preserves midcentury signs from around the city, including the iconic neon sign from the now-closed Brooklyn Heights restaurant Queen. The museum houses around 215 signs, many from the postwar era, which reflect the city's unique vernacular aesthetic and collective identity. Visitors like Carrie Hamilton and Julie Thompson appreciate the museum's nostalgic atmosphere and the stories behind each sign, with some pieces rescued from closure or even garbage. The museum's mission is to combat the homogenization of cityscapes by multinational chains and digital graphics, emphasizing product types over brands. Tours of the museum can be booked through its website, offering a glimpse into New York's fading past through its historic signage.
