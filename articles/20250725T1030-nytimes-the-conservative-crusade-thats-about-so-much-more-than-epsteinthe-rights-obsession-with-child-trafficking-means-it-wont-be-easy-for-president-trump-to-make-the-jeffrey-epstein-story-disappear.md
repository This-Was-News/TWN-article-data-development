## Article summary
The article discusses the intense focus on child sex abuse within conservative circles, driven by various factors including historical patterns, cultural anxieties, and recent high-profile cases like Jeffrey Epstein's. It highlights how concerns about child protection have been used to fuel moral panics and political movements, from the early 20th century to modern conspiracy theories like QAnon and Pizzagate. The Epstein case has become a focal point for conservatives, with many breaking from Trump over his dismissal of the issue. The article explores how these panics often coincide with societal changes, particularly shifts in women's roles. It concludes that the Epstein obsession is the culmination of decades of cultural anxiety and distrust in institutions, fueled by a history of sex panics and elite misconduct.
