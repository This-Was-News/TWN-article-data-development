## Article summary
President Trump has signed a new executive order targeting college sports, aiming to ban "pay-for-play" deals and mandating scholarships for women's and Olympic sports. The order empowers federal agencies to enforce these provisions, threatening to withhold federal funds from non-compliant schools. It seeks to address concerns about the future of non-revenue sports, which could be at risk as schools divert resources to compensate athletes in high-revenue sports like football and basketball. The order also targets lucrative name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, which have transformed athlete compensation. Legal experts question the order's legality, and its enforcement mechanisms, including the use of federal funds and Title IX enforcement, are seen as extreme. The NCAA and major college sports conferences have welcomed the order, but it may deepen partisan divides in Congress, complicating long-term reform efforts.
