## Article summary
President Trump's health care policies are expected to increase medical bills for millions of Americans, pushing more into debt. His administration's rollbacks of federal protections and cuts to programs like Medicaid will leave many uninsured and vulnerable to high costs. Significant increases in health plan premiums and changes to federal rules, such as those for COVID-19 vaccines, will further strain family budgets. The new tax cut legislation will raise the cost of certain doctor visits and remove protections for those in medical debt, impacting their credit scores. Despite Trump's promises to make health care more affordable, consumer advocates warn that these changes will undermine Americans' financial security, particularly for those with serious illnesses.
