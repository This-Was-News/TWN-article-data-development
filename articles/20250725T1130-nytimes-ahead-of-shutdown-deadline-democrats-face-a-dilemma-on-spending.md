## Article summary
As a government funding deadline approaches in September, Democrats are grappling with whether to compromise on spending with an administration that has repeatedly undermined congressional spending authority or risk a shutdown. In March, Democrats faced a similar dilemma and ultimately voted to advance a Republican-written stopgap spending measure, which led to backlash from their base. Republicans have recently passed legislation to claw back $9 billion in approved spending, and the White House plans to send another such package. Democrats are wary of the funding process and are strategizing to ensure they are united in their approach. They are seeking assurances from Senate Republicans that they will not allow the Trump administration to cancel spending after Congress approves the bills, but it is unclear if they can overcome this hurdle.
