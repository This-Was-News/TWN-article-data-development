## Article summary
The article explores the conservative fixation on child sex abuse, driven by various factors including cultural anxieties and historical patterns. It highlights how this issue has been weaponized politically, from Pizzagate and QAnon to the Epstein case, which has sparked significant outrage among Trump supporters. The text traces the historical context of child protection panics in America, linking them to societal changes and moral crusades. It notes how these panics have led to both genuine reforms and harmful conspiracies, such as the satanic panic of the 1980s. The Epstein case is seen as the culmination of these trends, fueled by broader public disillusionment with elite misconduct and government inaction.
