## Article summary
The future of PEPFAR, the U.S. program to combat HIV/AIDS, remains uncertain despite recent bipartisan efforts to preserve its funding. While PEPFAR escaped a $400 million cut proposed by the Trump administration, the program faces potential funding reductions and shifts in focus under the current administration. Experts express concerns about the impact of these changes, including disruptions in HIV prevention efforts and care for AIDS orphans. The expiration of PEPFAR's congressional authorization and delays in releasing operational plans for 2026 add to the uncertainty. Despite challenges, some HIV/AIDS specialists remain hopeful about PEPFAR's future, citing a resurgence of bipartisan commitment and plans to transition HIV control programs to recipient countries.
