## Article summary
President Trump is in Scotland for a four-day trip, which includes golfing at his courses and meetings with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The trip is overshadowed by the ongoing controversy surrounding his past association with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with Trump dismissing the concerns as "nonsense." Protests are expected during his visit, with demonstrators already holding up signs related to the Epstein questions as Trump's motorcade traveled to his golf course. Trump has been under pressure from supporters to release more information about Epstein's crimes and his 2019 death, but he has downplayed the need for further action. The trip's success may hinge on how Trump handles the media scrutiny and potential fallout from the Epstein controversy, with Republican pollster Jon McHenry noting that the British media is unlikely to give Trump a break.
