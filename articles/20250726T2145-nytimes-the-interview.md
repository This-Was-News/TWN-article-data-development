## Article summary
Robert Reich, a prominent figure in the fight against inequality, reflects on his career and the failures of the baby boomer generation in his upcoming memoir, "Coming Up Short." He argues that the baby boomers squandered the opportunities bequeathed to them, leading to increased inequality, a decline in social trust, and the rise of demagogues like Donald Trump. Reich attributes this to a culture of bullying and brutality, exacerbated by economic inequality and the influence of big money in politics. He also discusses the challenges Democrats face in connecting with struggling Americans and the importance of addressing economic bullying. Despite his criticisms, Reich acknowledges the positive contributions of the baby boomer generation, such as advances in civil rights and technology.
