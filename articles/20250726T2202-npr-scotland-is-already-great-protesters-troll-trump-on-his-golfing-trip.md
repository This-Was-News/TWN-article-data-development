## Article summary
President Trump's golfing trip to Scotland was met with protests, including signs mocking his "Make America Great Again" slogan and calls for his deportation. A recent poll showed that 71% of Scots hold an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with protesters criticizing his misuse of Scottish heritage and his focus on golf courses over helping his mother's home island. Questions about Trump's ties to Jeffrey Epstein followed him to Scotland, with protesters displaying photos of Trump and Epstein together and signs referencing Epstein's island. The Scottish police union has raised concerns about the cost and resource strain of Trump's security during his private visit. Trump is expected to meet with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Scottish First Minister John Swinney, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss trade deals, and he plans to return to the U.K. in September for a state visit with King Charles III.
