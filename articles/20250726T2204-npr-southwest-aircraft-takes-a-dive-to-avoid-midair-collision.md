## Article summary
A Southwest Airlines flight from Hollywood Burbank Airport to Las Vegas suddenly descended nearly 500 feet to avoid a midair collision after receiving a traffic alert. The incident occurred just six minutes after takeoff, with the Southwest Boeing 737 dropping from 14,100 feet to 13,600 feet. A decommissioned Hawker Hunter Mk.58 fighter jet was also in the same airspace, heading to Point Mugu Naval Air Station. One flight attendant was treated for minor injuries, and the flight landed uneventfully in Las Vegas. The incident follows a previous midair collision earlier this year, which highlighted FAA's shortcomings in addressing air traffic controller shortages.
