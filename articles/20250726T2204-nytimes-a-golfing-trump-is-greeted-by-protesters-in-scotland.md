## Article summary
President Trump golfed at his Turnberry course in Scotland while hundreds protested his visit, opposing his policies on immigration, the war in Gaza, and other issues. Protests were organized in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, with signs criticizing his policies and his association with Jeffrey Epstein. Trump boasted about his course and delivered messages to European leaders about halting mass migration and opposing wind power. He denied reports of being briefed about his name in the Epstein files and focused on trade deals instead. Trump planned to meet with Ursula von der Leyen to discuss a potential trade deal with the European Union, acknowledging a 50/50 chance of success.
