## Article summary
The future of PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, is uncertain despite its recent escape from funding cuts. PEPFAR, which has saved 26 million lives and significantly reduced HIV infection rates, faced severe disruptions due to U.S. foreign aid cuts, leading to clinic closures and reduced services. Experts express concern over potential funding cuts and the program's evolving focus, particularly the reduction in HIV prevention efforts and support for AIDS orphans. The lack of renewed authorization from Congress and delayed operational plans for 2026 add to the uncertainty. Despite challenges, there is hope for bipartisan support and a gradual transition of HIV control programs to recipient countries, ensuring PEPFAR's continued impact on global health.
