## Article summary
President Trump's golfing trip to Scotland sparked protests across the country, with demonstrators criticizing his policies, his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and the cost of his security to Scottish taxpayers. A distant relative of Trump, Janet MacLeod-Trotter, joined the protests, expressing shame over Trump's misuse of his Scottish heritage. Despite Trump's claims of a concluded U.K.-U.S. trade deal, he hinted at further discussions with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during his visit. Trump also addressed questions about his ties to Epstein, dismissing them as conspiracy theories and shifting focus to others. This private visit precedes an upcoming state visit to the U.K. in September, marking Trump's second state visit, following his 2019 meeting with Queen Elizabeth II.
