## Article summary
Southwest Airlines Flight 1496, en route to Las Vegas from Hollywood Burbank Airport, executed a rapid descent of nearly 500 feet to avoid a midair collision after receiving an onboard alert about another aircraft's proximity. The incident occurred just six minutes after takeoff within the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center airspace. Data from Flightradar24 indicated that the Southwest Boeing 737 dropped from 14,100 feet to 13,600 feet, while a decommissioned Hawker Hunter Mk.58 fighter jet was also in the vicinity. Southwest reported no customer injuries, but one flight attendant was treated for minor injuries and another was hospitalized. The flight continued to Las Vegas and landed uneventfully. Comedian Jimmy Dore, a passenger on the flight, described the aggressive dive on social media, noting that several passengers were thrown from their seats. This incident follows a midair collision earlier this year between a Black Hawk Army helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet, which highlighted FAA's failures to address the shortage of air traffic controllers. The FAA has stated that safety-critical positions were exempt from hiring freezes and that they have expanded hiring for air traffic controllers and safety professionals.
