## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has created an atmosphere of uncertainty and mistrust within the military, as seen in his handling of Lt. Gen. Douglas A. Sims II's promotion. Hegseth initially suspected Sims of leaking information, then later cited his association with Gen. Mark Milley as reasons for not promoting him, despite Sims being cleared of allegations. This conflict reflects a broader tension between Hegseth's partisan views and the military's tradition of apolitical service. Hegseth's actions have led to high turnover and infighting within the Pentagon, with several senior military officers being removed or resigning. Despite criticism and missteps, Hegseth retains President Trump's confidence, though his management style has drawn significant scrutiny and concern from both military officials and Congress.
