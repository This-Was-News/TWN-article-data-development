## Article summary
Washington is currently overwhelmed by competing conspiracy theories, with President Trump at the center of the frenzy. Trump's history of promoting conspiracy theories, such as the birtherism lie about Obama, has contributed to the current climate. The Epstein case has resurfaced, overshadowing important policy issues and prompting Speaker Mike Johnson to recess the House. Trump has attempted to deflect attention from the Epstein conspiracy by promoting new theories, including accusations of treason against Obama. The proliferation of conspiracy theories has drawn in foreign allies and both political parties, with Trump being the most prominent figure fueling these narratives.
