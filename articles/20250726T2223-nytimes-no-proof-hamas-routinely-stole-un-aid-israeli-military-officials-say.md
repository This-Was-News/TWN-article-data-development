## Article summary
Israeli military officials have not found evidence that Hamas systematically stole aid from the United Nations, the primary supplier of emergency assistance to Gaza. Despite this, Israel has used the claim of aid theft as a reason to restrict food entry into Gaza, leading to severe hunger and starvation among the population. International pressure has mounted on Israel to lift restrictions on humanitarian aid, with over 100 aid agencies and 28 governments condemning its approach. Israel has recently announced plans to revive aid drops and improve aid convoy routes, though details on implementation remain unclear. The new U.S.-run aid system has proven deadlier, with nearly 1,100 Palestinians killed while trying to access food handouts, often due to Israeli gunfire.
