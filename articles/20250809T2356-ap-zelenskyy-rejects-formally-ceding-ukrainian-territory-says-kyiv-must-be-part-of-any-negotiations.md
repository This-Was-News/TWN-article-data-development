## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly rejected the idea of ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia to end the ongoing war, emphasizing that Ukraine will not reward Russian aggression. He insisted that any negotiations to end the conflict must include Kyiv and dismissed the planned Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, stating that decisions made without Ukraine's involvement will not lead to peace. European and Ukrainian officials met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance to discuss ending the war, with Zelenskyy calling the talks constructive. Meanwhile, reactions in Kyiv to the idea of ceding territory ranged from skepticism to resigned acceptance, with some acknowledging the need for compromise to end the fighting. The war, which began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, with both sides far apart on their conditions for peace. The Kremlin's advisor suggested that holding the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska was symbolic, favoring Russia's historical claims. European leaders issued a joint statement supporting Ukraine and advocating for a combination of diplomacy, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia to end the war. Trump's announcement of the summit broke with expectations, as it was initially thought the leaders would meet in a third country. Analysts noted the symbolic significance of the Alaska location, referencing historical territorial transactions. Despite Trump's ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia, there has been no progress in stopping the fighting. The conflict continues with Russia's army advancing into Ukraine and relentless bombardments, while Ukraine's air force intercepts Russian drones and missiles.
