## Article summary
A Texas real estate magnate and trophy hunter, Asher Watkins, was killed by a Cape buffalo during a hunting expedition in South Africa. The incident was described as sudden and unprovoked by the safari company, Coenraad Vermaak Safaris (CVS). Watkins was tracking the buffalo when it attacked first, fatally injuring him. The safari company expressed condolences and respect for the family's privacy. Cape buffalo are known for their dangerous reputation, responsible for several deaths and injuries to hunters annually. Watkins' death sparked online discussions about the ethics of trophy hunting, with animal rights groups like PETA condemning the practice. Watkins was the leader of the Watkins Ranch Group, managing multimillion-dollar properties across Texas, Colorado, and Arkansas. He was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed fishing and hunting. Watkins is survived by his mother Gwen, daughter Savannah, brother Amon, and stepfather Tony.
