## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected the idea of ceding territory to Russia, following suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump that a peace deal between the two countries could involve territorial swaps. Trump's remarks were unclear about which territories might be involved, leaving Ukrainian officials uncertain. Zelensky stated that Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier and that decisions made without Ukraine's involvement are against peace. He argued that such decisions are 'dead decisions' that will not work. Zelensky's blunt rejection risks angering Trump, who has made a Ukraine-Russia peace deal a key foreign policy goal, even if it means accepting terms unfavorable to Kyiv. Trump has previously criticized Ukraine for what he sees as stubborn cease-fire demands and lack of readiness for peace. The territorial dispute is complex, with both Russian and Ukrainian lives lost in the conflict over the past three and a half years. Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine will regain some territory and that there will be territorial swaps for the betterment of both countries, but he did not specify which territories. The situation remains tense, with both leaders holding firm positions on the issue.
