## Article summary
A 30-year-old man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, opened fire at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer and injuring others. White's father told police that his son believed the COVID-19 vaccine made him depressed and suicidal. White was armed with five guns and had previously tried to enter the CDC headquarters before shooting at a nearby pharmacy. The shooting left bullet holes across the CDC campus, and employees were on lockdown for hours. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed support for CDC employees, but some former employees blamed him for fostering a climate of hostility and mistrust. Kennedy has a history of skepticism towards vaccines and has cut funding for vaccine development. The shooting has raised concerns about the safety of CDC employees, with some calling for a security assessment. Neighbors of White reported that he was deeply distrustful of COVID-19 vaccines. The shooter's motives remain under investigation, with authorities not yet confirming whether he was killed by police or took his own life. The incident has highlighted the tensions surrounding vaccine skepticism and the potential for violence.
