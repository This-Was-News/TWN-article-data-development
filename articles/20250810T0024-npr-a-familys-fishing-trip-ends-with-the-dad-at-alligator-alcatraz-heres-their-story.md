## Article summary
A family's fishing trip in the Everglades turned into a nightmare when the parents, who are in the U.S. without legal status, were arrested for not having a driver's license. The husband was sent to a controversial detention center nicknamed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' while the wife and baby were released with orders to leave the country. The wife, M., struggled to locate her husband and eventually learned he was being held at the facility, which has faced criticism for inhumane conditions. Reports describe extreme heat, inadequate water, vermin infestations, and health hazards due to mosquito-borne illnesses. Despite these allegations, officials dispute the claims, stating the facility meets federal standards. M.'s husband, who has no recent criminal record, is likely to be deported, prompting the family to plan their departure. The Trump administration is expanding similar detention centers across the country, with 'Alligator Alcatraz' serving as a model. Advocates and health professionals condemn the conditions, calling them a violation of human rights. The facility has become a focal point for protests and legal challenges, highlighting the ongoing debate over immigration policies.
