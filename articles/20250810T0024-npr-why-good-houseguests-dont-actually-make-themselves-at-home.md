## Article summary
The web page discusses etiquette tips for being a good houseguest. Etiquette expert Elane Swann advises that if you're comfortable hosting someone, you shouldn't feel shy about asking to stay with them when visiting their town. Key tips include giving your host at least three weeks' notice, keeping your visit short (around four days), and being mindful of your host's space and schedule. Communicate your needs and any allergies or physical limitations beforehand. While you should be self-sufficient, also offer to help with chores or treat your host to a meal. Avoid overpacking and leaving a mess. Bringing a small, thoughtful gift is appreciated. Do not rely on your host for transportation or disrupt their personal schedule. Always depart when you said you would and reciprocate by inviting your host to your place next time. The article emphasizes the importance of mutual respect and consideration to ensure your presence is a gift, not a burden.
