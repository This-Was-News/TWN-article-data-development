## Article summary
European and Ukrainian leaders gathered outside London to discuss concerns about an upcoming summit between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. They aimed to understand Putin's position and ensure Trump considers their perspectives, emphasizing that Ukraine must be involved in any negotiations. The Europeans supported Ukraine's stance that a cease-fire must precede territorial discussions and that Ukraine will not cede territory not currently occupied by Russia. They also insisted that no deal should be made without Ukraine and Europe's involvement. The meeting, hosted by British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Vice President JD Vance, included senior officials from Ukraine and Europe. The Europeans sought clarity on Putin's proposal, which reportedly includes Russian control over Crimea and the Donbas region in exchange for a cease-fire. They expressed concern that Trump and Putin might agree on a deal without Ukraine's consent. European leaders have committed to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and security, pushing for Zelensky's inclusion in follow-up meetings. They also advised Zelensky on maintaining a positive relationship with Trump. European countries have pledged to provide Ukraine with security guarantees post-settlement, but a resolution to the war is necessary first.
