## Article summary
The web page features a photo gallery showcasing protests in Israel demanding the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and an end to the 22-month war. The protests, held in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, include rallies, highway blockades, and demonstrations. Participants, including relatives and supporters of the hostages, call for the release of all captives and an end to the conflict. The protests coincide with Israel's plan to take over Gaza City, which has intensified international calls to end the war and raised concerns for the hostages' safety. The gallery includes images of demonstrators holding photos of hostages, such as Evyatar David, and former hostage Elya Cohen speaking at a rally. Mounted police are seen dispersing protesters blocking a highway. The protests also took place along the coast of Ashkelon, with participants looking towards the Gaza Strip.
