A 30-year-old man, Patrick Joseph White from Kennesaw, Georgia, was identified as the suspect in a shooting at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta. The incident resulted in the death of the shooter and Officer David Rose of the DeKalb County Police Department. The shooter opened fire outside the CDC headquarters, damaging multiple buildings and striking windows across the campus. No other injuries were reported. The gunman was found dead on the second floor of a nearby building, but the cause of death is still under investigation. Authorities recovered three additional firearms at the scene. The motive for the shooting remains unknown. Officer Rose, a former Marine who served in Afghanistan, was described as a dedicated and respected colleague. The incident has left Rose's wife and three children, including one unborn, without a father. The shooting prompted a significant law enforcement response to one of the nation's prominent public health institutions.
