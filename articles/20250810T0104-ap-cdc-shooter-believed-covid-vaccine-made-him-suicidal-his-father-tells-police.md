## Article summary
A 30-year-old man, identified as Patrick Joseph White, opened fire at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer and injuring others. White's father told police that his son believed the COVID-19 vaccine made him suicidal and depressed. White was armed with five guns and had tried to enter the CDC building before shooting at a nearby pharmacy. The shooting left bullet holes across the CDC campus, and employees were locked down for hours. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism, expressed support for CDC employees, but some former employees blamed him for the violence and called for his resignation. The shooter's neighbor reported that he often expressed distrust in COVID-19 vaccines. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of CDC employees, with some staff feeling like 'sitting ducks.' Senior CDC leadership has promised a full security assessment. The shooting has also highlighted the ongoing debate and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines.
