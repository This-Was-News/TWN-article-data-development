## Article summary
The web page showcases a photo gallery of protests in Israel demanding the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and an end to the 22-month war. The protests took place in various locations, including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Ashkelon, with participants holding photos of hostages and blocking highways. The demonstrations were attended by relatives and supporters of the hostages, who called for their release and an end to the conflict. The protests coincided with Israel's plan to take over Gaza City, which intensified international calls to end the conflict and raised concerns for the hostages still in Gaza. The photo gallery includes images of rallies outside the prime minister's office, highway blockades, and a former hostage speaking at a rally. The protests highlight the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the urgent demand for a resolution to the conflict.
