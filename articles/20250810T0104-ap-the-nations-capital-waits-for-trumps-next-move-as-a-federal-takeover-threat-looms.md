## Article summary
Washington, D.C. awaits President Donald Trump's promised federal law enforcement takeover, which was expected to begin at midnight Friday but showed no visible signs by early Friday morning. Trump's declaration aims to address crime in the capital, following a recent assault on a high-profile official. The planned security lockdown is set to last seven days, with the option to extend. Despite Trump's threats, Mayor Muriel Bowser's administration has seen a reduction in homicides and carjackings since 2023. Trump's actions include increased federal presence and potential National Guard deployment, though legal challenges may arise. The federal takeover would require repealing the Home Rule Act of 1973, which granted D.C. residents local governance. Trump's critics argue his actions are heavy-handed, while his supporters see them as necessary to combat crime. The National Park Service has intensified efforts to clear homeless encampments and enforce laws in public parks. Additionally, a Confederate statue toppled in 2020 will be restored and replaced, aligning with Trump's executive order on historical monuments.
