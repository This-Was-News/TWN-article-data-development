## Article summary
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly rejected the idea of ceding territory to Russia to end the ongoing war, stating that Ukraine will not reward Russia for its actions and will not give land to the occupier. Zelenskyy emphasized that any negotiations to end the conflict must include Kyiv. European and Ukrainian officials met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in England to discuss ending the war, which Zelenskyy described as constructive. He expressed confidence in the U.S.'s ability to ensure the war's end. Earlier, Zelenskyy dismissed the planned Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, warning that any decisions without Ukraine's involvement would be against peace. Ukrainian officials previously indicated they would accept a peace deal that de facto recognizes Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily. The Trump-Putin meeting, scheduled for Friday in Alaska, may be pivotal but is unlikely to stop the fighting due to the vast differences in peace conditions between Moscow and Kyiv. European leaders issued a joint statement supporting Ukraine and advocating for a combined approach of diplomacy, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia. Analysts suggested that Russia might offer to give up territory it controls outside the four regions it claims to have annexed. On the streets of Kyiv, reactions to the idea of ceding territory ranged from skepticism to quiet resignation, with some accepting it for compensation and reparations, while others rejected any concessions but supported halting combat to save lives. The Kremlin's larger army is advancing into Ukraine at a high cost in troops and armor, while relentlessly bombarding Ukrainian cities. On Saturday, Russian drone attacks resulted in deaths and injuries in Kherson and the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine's air force intercepted some of the Russian drones and missiles launched overnight, while Russia claimed to have shot down numerous Ukrainian drones over Russia and the Black Sea.
