## Article summary
A family's fishing trip in the Everglades turned into a nightmare when the parents, who are undocumented immigrants, were arrested for not having driver's licenses. The husband was sent to a controversial detention center nicknamed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' while the wife and baby were released with an order to leave the country. The wife, identified as M., struggled to locate her husband and faced difficulties due to the lack of information provided by immigration officials. 'Alligator Alcatraz,' a state-run facility, has faced criticism for its conditions, including extreme heat, inadequate water, and vermin infestations. Advocates and health professionals have raised concerns about the facility's impact on detainees' health. Despite these allegations, officials maintain that the facility meets federal standards. M.'s husband described the conditions as horrific, with insufficient water and extreme heat. The family's future is uncertain, with M. planning to follow her husband if he is deported to El Salvador. The Trump administration has defended the facility and plans to expand similar detention centers across the country.
