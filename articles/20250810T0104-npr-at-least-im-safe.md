## Article summary
Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan immigrant living in Michigan for over 16 years, faces deportation due to a past immigration case involving a fraudulent marriage. Despite having degrees and a stable job, he fears the Trump administration's strict immigration policies. Kangethe decides to self-deport to Kenya rather than face potential detention or deportation. His family struggles with the decision, and his community expresses sadness and support. Kangethe hopes to return safely to his family one day, but the emotional toll is significant. His story highlights the broader impact of immigration policies on families and communities. Over 7,000 immigrants have used a government app to self-deport, but the actual number is likely higher. Kangethe's departure leaves a void in his community and family, underscoring the human cost of immigration enforcement.
