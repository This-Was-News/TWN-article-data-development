## Article summary
The article discusses etiquette tips for being a good houseguest. Etiquette expert Elane Swann advises that being a considerate guest starts with respecting someone else's space. She suggests asking to stay with someone only if you'd feel comfortable hosting them in your own home, giving at least three weeks' notice, and being prepared for either a yes or no answer. Swann recommends keeping visits short, typically around four days and three nights, and adjusting plans based on the space and needs of everyone involved. Guests should communicate their needs and any pertinent information, such as allergies or physical limitations, to avoid awkwardness. Swann advises against overpacking and making a mess, and suggests offering to help with chores or treating the host to a meal. She also recommends not relying on the host for transportation and not impeding on their personal schedule. Guests should not overstay their welcome and should make sure to say goodbye and thank each member of the household. Finally, Swann suggests returning the favor by inviting the host to your place for the next get-together.
