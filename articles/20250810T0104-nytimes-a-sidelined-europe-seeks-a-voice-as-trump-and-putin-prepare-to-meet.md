## Article summary
European and Ukrainian leaders gathered outside London to discuss concerns about an upcoming summit between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. They aimed to understand Putin's position and ensure Trump recognizes the stakes involved. The meeting demonstrated solidarity with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and emphasized the importance of considering their joint perspectives. European officials reiterated support for Ukraine's stance, including the need for a cease-fire before territorial talks, refusal to cede unoccupied territory to Russia, and the necessity of security guarantees, including from the United States. They stressed that any deal should not be made without involving Ukrainians or Europeans, who Trump expects to handle post-settlement security for Ukraine. The officials also maintained that NATO should not close the door on Ukrainian membership, despite current impracticality. The meeting, hosted by British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Vice President JD Vance, included senior officials from Ukraine and Europe, with Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, participating virtually. The Europeans focused on learning what Putin discussed with Witkoff regarding a resolution to end Russia's war with Ukraine.
