Russia has intensified its assaults on Ukraine, employing new tactics and distant strikes. This escalation coincides with President Trump's threats of new sanctions against Moscow and his preparation to meet with Russia's leader. The conflict has been ongoing, with reporters Marc Santora and Mara Varenkova, along with photographers David Guttenfelder and Tyler Hicks, documenting the situation from various locations in Ukraine, including Kyiv, Pokrovsk, Kharkiv, and Sumy. Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the war's beginning and has extensive experience covering international news. Hicks, a senior photographer for The Times, has won prestigious awards for his work, including the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography.
