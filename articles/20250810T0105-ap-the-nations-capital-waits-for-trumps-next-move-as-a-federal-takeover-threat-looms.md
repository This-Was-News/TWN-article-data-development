## Article summary
Washington, D.C. awaits President Donald Trump's planned federal law enforcement takeover, which was announced but not visibly implemented by Friday morning. Trump's declaration aims to address crime, particularly after a recent assault and attempted carjacking involving teenagers. The federal presence, involving agencies like the Secret Service and FBI, is set to last seven days, with the option to extend. Mayor Muriel Bowser's administration has not publicly responded, despite Trump's criticism of D.C.'s safety and governance. Crime rates, including carjackings, have decreased, but juvenile involvement remains high. Emergency legislation has been enacted to curb youth-related disturbances. Trump's actions are within his authority, but further steps, like taking over the police department, would require an emergency declaration and likely face legal challenges. A full federal takeover would necessitate repealing the Home Rule Act of 1973, which granted D.C. residents local governance. Trump's administration has already increased enforcement actions, such as clearing homeless encampments and restoring Confederate statues. The situation reflects Trump's pattern of using emergency declarations for various issues during his second term.
