## Article summary
Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan immigrant living in Michigan for over 16 years, has decided to self-deport due to his ongoing immigration case and the Trump administration's policies. His immigration status is tied to a previous marriage deemed fraudulent, making him deportable despite having no criminal record. Kangethe, an accountant with a master's degree, fears detention and deportation, so he chose to leave on his own terms. His family is struggling with this decision, and his community is affected by his departure. Kangethe's employer and friends express sadness and concern, with some even trying to intervene in his case. Despite the emotional toll, Kangethe believes this is the best path for him and his family, hoping to return to the U.S. safely in the future. The story highlights the impact of immigration policies on individuals and communities, as well as the difficult choices immigrants face under such circumstances.
