## Article summary
Russia has intensified its assaults on Ukraine, employing long-range strikes, drones, and new tactics, despite President Trump's threats of new sanctions and plans to meet with Russia's leader. The war shows no signs of abating, with Russia focusing on the eastern city of Pokrovsk and other strategic areas. Russia's strategy includes using small units backed by drones to infiltrate and attack Ukrainian positions. Despite diplomatic efforts, Russia continues to push forward on the ground, aiming to gain territory through a war of attrition. Ukraine faces significant challenges in adapting to the evolving drone threat and maintaining its defense lines. The front lines have transformed into a complex battlefield with scattered forces and constant drone surveillance. Ukraine's military is struggling with supply issues and high casualties, as seen in the relentless fighting around Pokrovsk. The situation remains dire, with Ukrainian forces digging extensive defensive lines and evacuating nearby villages. Ukrainian soldiers express a grim outlook, relying on their own resilience rather than diplomatic solutions. The war's intensity and the strategic maneuvers by both sides highlight the ongoing struggle for control and territory.
