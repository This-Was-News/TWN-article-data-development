## Article summary
A U.S. tourist, Kevin Mares, was fatally shot in Puerto Rico's La Perla neighborhood during a visit for a Bad Bunny concert. The 25-year-old from New York was an innocent bystander during an argument that escalated into gunfire. Mares and three friends were at a nightspot called Refuge for Mistreated Men when the shooting occurred. Two local residents were also injured and hospitalized. Authorities have little information about the shooter or the argument's cause. La Perla, once notorious for drug trafficking and violence, has seen improvements but still experiences isolated violent incidents. Recent attacks on tourists include stabbings and a killing followed by arson. Puerto Rico has reported 277 killings this year, down from 325 in the same period last year. The neighborhood's safety has improved since federal raids and cultural exposure through music, but risks remain for visitors.
