## Article summary
An Associated Press review reveals that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to federal courts have expressed anti-abortion views, been linked to anti-abortion groups, or defended abortion restrictions. These nominees, with lifetime appointments, could potentially roll back abortion rights for decades. Trump has shifted his messaging on abortion, initially supporting federal bans but later advocating for states to decide. His nominees include individuals who have called abortion a barbaric practice and spread misinformation about medication abortion. Legal experts warn of a strategic reshaping of the federal courts that could threaten abortion access nationwide. Trump's campaign focused primarily on the economy and immigration, but his judicial appointments could have long-lasting impacts on abortion rights. Anti-abortion advocates are hopeful about the nominees, while abortion rights advocates criticize Trump for embedding anti-abortion opponents in the judiciary.
