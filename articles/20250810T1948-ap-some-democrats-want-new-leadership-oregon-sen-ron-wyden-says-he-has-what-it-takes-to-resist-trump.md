## Article summary
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat in his fifth decade in Congress, plans to seek another term in 2028 at age 79, despite pressure on aging Democratic officeholders to step aside. Wyden, who holds town halls in all 36 Oregon counties annually, insists he has the energy and commitment to resist President Donald Trump's policies. He argues that accountability is important but believes in a results-oriented approach to government. Some Democrats, including Amanda Litman of Run for Something, advocate for older politicians to step down to make room for new leaders. Wyden's persistence contrasts with other Democratic senators who have announced they won't seek re-election. During a town hall in conservative Sherman County, Wyden addressed concerns about Trump's administration and discussed issues like healthcare, trade, and immigration. He emphasized the importance of town halls in reducing polarization and mistrust. Wyden also highlighted his efforts to obtain information on the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, a political cross for Trump. He advised Democrats to engage more with conservative areas to understand their constituents better. Wyden's approach underscores his commitment to connecting with voters across political spectrums.
