## Article summary
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser responded to President Donald Trump's threats to take federal control of the city's police department, defending D.C.'s control and expressing concerns about the deployment of the National Guard. Bowser highlighted a two-year drop in violent crime, contradicting White House claims of out-of-control violence. Trump directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in D.C. after a former White House staffer was assaulted. Bowser criticized hyperbolic statements comparing D.C. to a war-torn country and emphasized the need for more federal prosecutors, judges, and infrastructure repairs. She also opposed the deployment of the National Guard, stating they are not law enforcement officials. Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard and considered taking control of the Metropolitan Police Department, but Bowser denied this was a realistic possibility. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith ordered a juvenile curfew in the Navy Yard neighborhood due to safety concerns. Trump criticized Bowser's efforts, stating that crime numbers were worsening and the city was becoming dirtier and less attractive.
