## Article summary
Dmitri N. Kozak, a long-time aide to President Vladimir V. Putin, has lost significant influence after privately criticizing the Ukraine war. Kozak, who once managed key assignments like the 2014 Crimea annexation and 2014 Winter Olympics preparations, now holds little power. His role has been largely taken over by another Putin ally, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, who supports the military action. Kozak, 66, reportedly advised Putin against the invasion and later proposed peace negotiations and domestic reforms, including oversight of security agencies and an independent judiciary. Kremlin insiders and a Western contact revealed that Kozak presented these ideas to Putin. Kozak's disillusionment with the war has disappointed Putin, leading to his diminished role. The shift in power highlights the consequences of dissent within Putin's inner circle. Kozak's criticism and proposals for change mark a significant departure from his previously loyal stance.
