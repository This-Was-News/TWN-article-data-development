## Article summary
A U.S. tourist, Kevin Mares, was fatally shot in Puerto Rico's La Perla neighborhood during a visit for a Bad Bunny concert. The incident occurred at a nightspot called Refuge for Mistreated Men, where an argument escalated into a shooting. Mares, a 25-year-old from New York, was an innocent bystander and died from his injuries. Two local residents were also injured in the shooting. Police are investigating the motive and have little information about the shooter. La Perla, once notorious for drug trafficking and violence, has seen improvements but still experiences isolated violent incidents. Recent attacks on tourists in the area include a stabbing in February 2023 and a killing in April 2024. Despite these incidents, Puerto Rico has reported fewer killings this year compared to the same period last year. The neighborhood has become safer and more welcoming, partly due to federal interventions and cultural influences. However, the shooting highlights ongoing safety concerns for tourists.
