## Article summary
An Associated Press review reveals that several of President Donald Trump's nominees to federal courts have expressed anti-abortion views, been linked to anti-abortion groups, or defended abortion restrictions. These nominees, with lifetime appointments, could potentially roll back abortion rights long after Trump's presidency. Trump has shifted his messaging on abortion, initially supporting federal bans and later stating that abortion decisions should be left to the states. Legal experts and abortion rights advocates warn that these judicial appointments could pose enduring threats to abortion access nationwide. They argue that these appointments are a strategic way to shape abortion policies without direct legislative action. White House spokesperson Harrision Felds defended the nominees, aligning them with Trump's promises and the Supreme Court's rulings. Anti-abortion advocates are hopeful about the nominees' potential support for their objectives. Meanwhile, abortion rights activists criticize Trump for appointing anti-abortion extremists to the judiciary while publicly distancing himself from the issue. Trump's 2024 campaign focused primarily on the economy and immigration, but his judicial appointments continue to impact abortion rights.
