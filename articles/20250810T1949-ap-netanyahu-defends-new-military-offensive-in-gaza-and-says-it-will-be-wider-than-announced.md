## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended an expanded military offensive in Gaza, aiming to dismantle Hamas strongholds beyond initially announced areas, including refugee camps. Despite growing domestic and international criticism, Netanyahu asserted that Israel must complete the defeat of Hamas. The offensive includes targeting Gaza City, Muwas, and Der al-Balah, with plans to create safe zones, though past designated areas have been bombed. Netanyahu denied allegations of starvation in Gaza, stating there were shortages but no policy of starvation, and plans to increase aid distribution sites. He also directed the military to allow more foreign journalists into Gaza. Hamas dismissed Netanyahu's remarks as lies. The U.S. supported Israel's right to decide its security measures, while other U.N. members expressed alarm. At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, with witnesses accusing Israeli forces of firing at crowds. The conflict has displaced most Palestinians and pushed the territory toward famine, with malnutrition-related deaths rising. Relatives of hostages urged a labor strike in Israel, fearing the expanded military operations would endanger their loved ones. Protests against the offensive occurred near the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem.
