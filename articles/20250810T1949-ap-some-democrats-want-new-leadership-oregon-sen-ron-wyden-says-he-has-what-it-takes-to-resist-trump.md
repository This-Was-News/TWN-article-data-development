## Article summary
Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, now in his fifth decade in Congress, plans to seek another term in 2028 at age 79, despite growing pressure on aging Democratic officials to retire. Wyden, who has held town halls in all 36 Oregon counties annually, insists he has the energy to resist President Donald Trump's policies. While many Democrats have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden's decision to seek a second term and his eventual withdrawal, Wyden believes in accountability and a results-oriented approach. Several Democratic senators, including Dick Durbin, have announced they will not seek re-election. Wyden's commitment to engaging with voters, including in conservative areas like Sherman County, sets him apart from congressional Republicans who have largely avoided town halls. During a recent town hall in Wasco, Wyden addressed concerns about Trump's administration and discussed issues like healthcare, trade, and immigration. He emphasized the importance of legal immigration and shared his family's history as immigrants fleeing Nazi Germany. Wyden has also been a leading Democratic voice in pressing for more information on the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. He advises Democrats to hold more meetings in conservative areas to better understand the people they represent and to combat low voter morale and strategic uncertainties.
