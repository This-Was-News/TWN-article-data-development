## Article summary
The Trump administration is dismissing asylum cases of applicants who entered the U.S. between 2019 and 2022, citing the lack of a mandatory 'credible fear' interview at the border. This interview, conducted by an asylum officer, is a prerequisite for filing an asylum application. The U.S. has faced a shortage of asylum officers to conduct these interviews due to a significant influx of border-crossers, leading to a backlog. The administration is now dismissing applications, forcing applicants to restart the process they began years ago. This move is part of a broader effort to strip protections from long-term residents, making the asylum process more expensive and reviewing previously filed claims. Lawyers fear that their clients, who have been waiting years for interviews, may be caught up in mass deportation efforts. Asylum provides protection to those who have entered the U.S. or are at a port of entry, allowing them to work, pay taxes, and enroll in school. The dismissal of applications leaves applicants without status or protection, potentially leading to detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Lawyers have received different versions of dismissal letters, with some instructing applicants to await notice from ICE for their interviews, while others tell them to report to ICE first. The Trump administration's new policy requires migrants who entered the country illegally to be detained without an opportunity for release while they fight their cases, further complicating the situation for asylum seekers.
