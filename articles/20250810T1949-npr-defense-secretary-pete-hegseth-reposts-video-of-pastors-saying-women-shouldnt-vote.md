## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reposted and praised a video interview of Doug Wilson, a self-described Christian nationalist pastor whose church believes women should not vote. Wilson, senior pastor of Christ Church in Idaho, stated during the CNN interview that women are responsible for the souls of their family members and should not vote. He also defended previous comments about the mutual affection between slaves and their masters and advocated for the recriminalization of sodomy. Hegseth added the phrase 'All of Christ for All of Life' to his repost. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed that Hegseth is a proud member of a church affiliated with the Congregation of Reformed Evangelical Churches, founded by Wilson. In the video, a congregant explained that she submits to her husband as the head of the household, and another pastor suggested that families should vote as a household, with the husband casting the vote. Sociology professor Andrew Whitehead noted that Wilson and his followers aim to spread and enforce these ideas nationwide. Christ Church, which is expanding across the country, recently opened a new location in the nation's capital, reportedly attended by Hegseth and his family. Whitehead emphasized the significance of a high-ranking government official sharing such views, as it impacts all Americans. The implications of these views on women's voting rights, combat roles, and perspectives on slavery are concerning given Hegseth's position of power.
