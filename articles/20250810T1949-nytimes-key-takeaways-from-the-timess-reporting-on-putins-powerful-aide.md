## Article summary
Serge V. Kryenko, a 63-year-old first deputy chief of staff to President Vladimir V. Putin, has become a pivotal figure in Putin's autocratic regime, particularly since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Known initially as a Western-oriented reformer, Kryenko has evolved into a key engineer of Putin's power, managing various critical aspects of Russia's governance. He oversees domestic politics, regional governments, and the coordination of crackdowns on dissent. Kryenko's influence extends to controlling the internet, indoctrinating schoolchildren with Putin's ideology, managing relations with former Soviet Union countries, and overseeing occupied Ukraine. His strategic partnership with Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a media and banking magnate, has accelerated Putin's push toward autocracy. Unlike other advisors, Kryenko embraced the war against Ukraine, planning sham referendums and taking over the portfolios of those who opposed the invasion. He has shown creativity in wielding state powers to serve Putin, including promoting patriotic content and organizing pro-war propaganda. Despite plans for a public war crimes trial of Ukrainians, it never materialized due to struggles on the battlefield. Kryenko's adaptability and effectiveness have made him indispensable to Putin's regime.
