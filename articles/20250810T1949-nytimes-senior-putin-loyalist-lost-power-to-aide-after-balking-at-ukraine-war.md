## Article summary
Dmitri N. Kozak, a longtime aide to President Vladimir V. Putin, has lost influence after privately criticizing the invasion of Ukraine. Kozak, who has been involved in key assignments for Putin, including managing the 2014 annexation of Crimea and preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympics, has been sidelined in favor of another Putin ally, Sergei V. Kiriyenko. Kozak, now 66, has reportedly advised Putin against the invasion and proposed peace negotiations and domestic reforms, including overseeing Russia's security agencies and building an independent judiciary. His shift in stance has led to a significant reduction in his responsibilities within the Kremlin.
