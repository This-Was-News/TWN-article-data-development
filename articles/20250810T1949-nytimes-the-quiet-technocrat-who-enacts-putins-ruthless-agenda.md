## Article summary
Serge V. Kryenko, a key figure in the Russian government, has been instrumental in managing the political aspects of the Ukraine war and enforcing President Vladimir V. Putin's agenda. Known for his efficiency and loyalty, Kryenko oversees wide-ranging government efforts to tighten Putin's grip on Russia and occupied Ukraine. His responsibilities include cracking down on domestic opposition, expanding Kremlin control over the internet, and shaping propaganda and governance in occupied regions. Kryenko's influence has grown, taking over portfolios from other Putin aides who disagreed with the invasion of Ukraine. He is described as a proficient bureaucrat who executes tasks without implementing his own plans. Kryenko's career includes a brief stint as Russia's prime minister and roles in managing Rosatom, the state nuclear energy conglomerate. He has deepened bonds with influential figures like banker Yur V. Kovalchuk, one of Putin's closest friends. Kryenko's efforts also extend to reintegrating Ukrainian war veterans into civilian life and promoting state-affiliated messaging apps. His role in staging referendums in occupied Ukraine to legitimize Russia's land grab highlights his strategic prowess. Despite his modest title, Kryenko represents a crucial aspect of Putin's power, forming part of a cadre of skilled managers who direct the Russian state.
