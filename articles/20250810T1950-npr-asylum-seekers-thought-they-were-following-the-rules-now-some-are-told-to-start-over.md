## Article summary
Asylum-seekers who entered the U.S. between 2019 and 2022 are being told their cases have been dismissed because they did not receive a mandatory 'credible fear' interview at the border. The Trump administration is dismissing these cases, forcing applicants to start the process over. This is part of a broader effort to strip protections from long-term residents, making the asylum process more expensive and reviewing previously filed claims. Lawyers fear their clients, who have been waiting years for interviews, may be caught up in mass deportation efforts. Asylum grants protection to those who have entered the U.S. or are at a port of entry, allowing them to work, pay taxes, and enroll in school. USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser stated that applications are closed if an individual is marked for 'expedited removal.' Immigration attorneys warn that the shortage of asylum officers has led to significant backlogs, with some clients waiting up to six years for their cases to be reviewed. Letters notifying applicants of dismissals began arriving in July, with unclear instructions on next steps. Attorney Mara Florencia Garcia noted that one client, who was released into the U.S. before his interview, was unable to reschedule and now faces detention if he reports to ICE. Arno Lemus, another immigration attorney, views this as an attempt to retroactively reclassify asylum applicants who primarily arrived during the Biden years. The Trump administration's new policy requires detained migrants without an opportunity for release, raising concerns among lawyers that their clients may be detained if they report to ICE.
