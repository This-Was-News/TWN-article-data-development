## Article summary
Serge V. Kryenko, a 63-year-old first deputy chief of staff to President Vladimir V. Putin, has become a pivotal figure in Putin's autocratic regime, particularly since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Known for his adaptability and influence, Kryenko has overseen various aspects of Russian governance, including domestic politics, regional governments, and the crackdown on dissent. He has also been instrumental in managing Russia's internet control, indoctrinating schoolchildren with Putin's ideology, and overseeing occupied Ukraine. Kryenko's power is bolstered by his strategic partnership with Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a media and banking magnate, who helped bring Kryenko back into the Kremlin. Initially seen as a pro-Western reformer in the 1990s, Kryenko has embraced Putin's war against Ukraine, setting him apart from other advisors like Dmitry N. Kozak, who opposed the invasion. Kryenko's role has expanded to include managing relations with former Soviet countries and planning sham referendums in occupied Ukraine. He has creatively used his oversight of culture, education, and regional governments to promote patriotic content and pro-war propaganda. Despite plans to stage a public war crimes trial of Ukrainians, the trial did not materialize due to struggles on the battlefield. Kryenko's versatility and effectiveness as a technocrat have made him indispensable to Putin's long-term rule.
