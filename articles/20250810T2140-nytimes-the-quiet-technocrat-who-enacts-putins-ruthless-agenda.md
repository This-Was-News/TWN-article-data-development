## Article summary
The article by Anton Troanovsk, Moscow bureau chief for The New York Times, explores the role of Kremlin official Serge V. Kryenko in enabling President Vladimir Putin and managing the Ukraine war. Kryenko, known for his commitment to healthy living, has been instrumental in stage-managing referendums in occupied Ukraine to give the impression of regional support for joining Russia. He boasted about these referendums to a visiting businessman, detailing the expected results. Kryenko is described as a calm, ambitious bureaucrat solving technical problems. Over the past three years, his influence has grown, making him the key figure in turning Putin's ideas into action. He oversees extensive government efforts to tighten Putin's grip on Russia and occupied Ukraine. Recently, Kryenko gained more power within the Kremlin by taking over the portfolio of a Putin aide who disagreed with the invasion of Ukraine. The article highlights Kryenko's significant role in the current political and military strategies of the Russian government.
