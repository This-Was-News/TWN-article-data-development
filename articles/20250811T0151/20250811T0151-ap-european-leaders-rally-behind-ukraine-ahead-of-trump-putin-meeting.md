## Article summary
European leaders have expressed strong support for Ukraine, emphasizing that any resolution to the ongoing war must involve Ukraine's participation. This stance comes ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump aims to discuss ending the four-year conflict. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed gratitude for the European support and reiterated that the war must end. Concerns have been raised about potential peace deals that might involve territorial concessions by Ukraine, which European leaders have firmly opposed. The White House has indicated that Trump remains open to a trilateral summit but will initially hold a bilateral meeting with Putin. U.S. Vice President JD Vance has suggested that Trump has secured Putin's agreement to meet with Zelenskyy, though scheduling details are pending. The upcoming Trump-Putin meeting is seen as pivotal, though there are no guarantees it will halt the fighting, as Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on peace terms. European leaders have stressed the importance of a just and lasting peace for Ukraine, including robust security guarantees and the principle that international borders must not be changed by force. The European statement follows a meeting between Vance and top European and Ukrainian officials to discuss ending the war. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham has emphasized the need for preventing Russia from redrawing borders by force and ensuring robust security guarantees for Ukraine.
