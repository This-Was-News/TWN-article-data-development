## Article summary
Severe storms and heavy rainfall led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair in West Allis, near Milwaukee. The flooding caused power outages, stranded vehicles, and closed roads across multiple Midwest states, including Wisconsin, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Illinois. The National Weather Service issued flood watches and warnings, predicting continued heavy rain, hail, damaging winds, and possible tornadoes. In Milwaukee, up to 14 inches of rain fell, causing river flooding and submerging a playground in Wauwatosa. The Milwaukee Fire Department responded to over 600 emergency calls, including water rescues and gas leaks. The Red Cross opened shelters for displaced residents, and crews worked to clear surface water. USA Triathlon canceled its Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee, while the Brewers and Mets played a game despite inaccessible parking lots. Authorities warned residents to avoid standing water due to ongoing dangers. In Nebraska, strong winds caused a fatality and damaged a prison, displacing hundreds of inmates.
