## Article summary
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a new, broader military offensive in Gaza, aiming to dismantle Hamas strongholds beyond Gaza City, including refugee camps. Despite growing domestic and international criticism, Netanyahu asserted that Israel has no choice but to defeat Hamas. He claimed the operation would create safe zones, though past designated areas have been bombed. Netanyahu denied allegations of starvation in Gaza, stating there were only shortages, and announced plans to allow more foreign journalists into the region. The U.S. supported Israel's right to decide its security measures, while other UN Security Council members expressed alarm. At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, with witnesses accusing Israeli forces of firing on crowds. The conflict has displaced most Palestinians and pushed the territory toward famine, with malnutrition-related deaths rising. Relatives of hostages urged a labor strike in Israel, fearing the expanded military operations would endanger their loved ones. Demonstrations occurred near the Gaza border and the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, protesting the offensive and calling for the release of hostages. The situation in Gaza remains dire, with humanitarian conditions described as horrific.
