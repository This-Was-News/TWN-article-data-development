## Article summary
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer met privately with President Donald Trump to discuss the negative impact of his tariffs on Michigan's auto industry. Whitmer, a Democrat, presented a case against the tariffs, which she argued were harming the industry Trump claims to support. This meeting was significant as Whitmer is seen as a potential contender for her party's 2028 presidential nomination. The tariffs have led to job losses, reduced profits, and potential price increases, according to industry leaders. Whitmer's presentation highlighted the economic damage and sought federal support for storm recovery and a delay in Medicaid changes. Trump did not make specific commitments during the meeting. The auto industry is crucial to Michigan's economy, supporting nearly 600,000 jobs. Automakers like General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis have warned that tariffs could undermine their competitiveness. Despite these warnings, Trump has imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other imports. The tariffs have already cost automakers hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially impacting future investments. The outcome of these policies could influence voter perceptions and future elections, especially in swing states like Michigan.
