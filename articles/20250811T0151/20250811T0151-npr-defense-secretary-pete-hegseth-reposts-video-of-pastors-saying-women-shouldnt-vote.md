## Article summary
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted and praised a video interview featuring Doug Wilson, a self-described Christian nationalist pastor who opposes women's voting rights. Wilson, senior pastor of Christ Church in Idaho, argued that women should not vote, as they are primarily responsible for the home and family. He also defended past comments about the affection between slaves and their masters and advocated for the recriminalization of sodomy. Hegseth added a supportive caption to the reposted video. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed that Hegseth is a member of a church affiliated with Wilson and appreciates his teachings. The CNN video also showed a congregant and another pastor expressing similar views on women's roles and voting. Andrew Whitehead, a sociology professor, noted that Wilson and his followers aim to spread and enforce these beliefs nationwide. Christ Church, which is expanding across the country, recently opened a new location in the nation's capital, reportedly attended by Hegseth and his family. Whitehead emphasized the significance of a high-ranking government official promoting such views, as it impacts all Americans. The story highlights the potential influence of these beliefs on national policies and societal norms.
