## Article summary
The Trump administration plans to temporarily reassign 120 F.B.I. agents in Washington to nighttime patrol duties as part of President Trump's crackdown on the city's street crime. Most agents will be pulled from their regular duties at the F.B.I.'s Washington field office, but it's unclear if additional personnel will be needed from nearby cities. The F.B.I. confirmed the agents' participation in the increased federal law enforcement presence in Washington, referring further questions to the White House. The temporary reassignments were first reported by The Washington Post. President Trump has claimed that crime in Washington is spiraling out of control, despite statistics showing violent crime hit a 30-year low last year and is down another 26 percent so far this year. Youth crime has been a persistent problem for city officials. Trump threatened to put Washington under federal control after a prominent member of the Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted during an attempted carjacking. He plans to announce his plan to fight crime in the city on Monday morning. This is not the first time the Trump administration has reallocated F.B.I. personnel to follow the president's priorities, as roughly 900 agents have been temporarily assigned to help with immigration enforcement. F.B.I. agents, primarily investigators, may face challenges in making meaningful contributions to patrol-focused assignments. They are often used to provide additional security on the streets while other law enforcement officers handle their jobs.
