## Article summary
President Donald Trump's judicial nominees, many of whom have expressed anti-abortion views or have been involved in defending abortion restrictions, could significantly influence abortion access nationwide for decades. Roughly half of Trump's nominees in his second term have revealed anti-abortion views or have been associated with anti-abortion groups. While Trump has indicated that abortion should be a state issue, his judicial appointments could roll back abortion access long after his presidency. Several nominees have played prominent roles in defending state abortion restrictions in court, including cases involving medication abortion. Trump's first term saw him appoint 234 judges, with more than one-quarter of active federal judges being his nominees, including three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Many of his second-term nominees are from states with severe abortion restrictions. Notable nominees include Whitney Hermandorfer, who challenged laws related to abortion and transgender rights, and Mara Lanahan, who helped write a lawsuit challenging FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. Other nominees, such as Jordan Pratt and Joshua Dvne, have made strong anti-abortion statements and defended state abortion bans. Anti-abortion groups are optimistic about Trump's nominees, while abortion rights advocates warn that these appointments could undermine access to abortion. The nominees' roles in defending abortion restrictions suggest a long-term impact on abortion laws and access.
