## Article summary
In western Colorado, firefighters are battling lightning-caused wildfires that have consumed over 120,000 acres, driven by drought-stressed fuels and windy conditions. The Lee Fire, the larger of the two, has led to evacuations in two counties and threatened the town of Meeker. The fires are challenging to contain due to climate change exacerbating the flammability of overgrown forests and scrubland. Firefighters have faced dangerous conditions, including having to retreat for safety. Despite these challenges, resources have been quickly mobilized due to a relatively quiet wildfire season so far. Michelle Morgan, owner of the Elk Mountain Inn in Meeker, expressed relief as crews built containment lines and managed hot spots. Meanwhile, the Gfford Fire in Southern California has also burned over 117,000 acres, causing evacuations in remote areas. Both states face continued hot, dry, and windy conditions, offering no immediate relief for firefighters. The Lee Fire was at one point within a mile of burning into Meeker, highlighting the severity of the situation.
