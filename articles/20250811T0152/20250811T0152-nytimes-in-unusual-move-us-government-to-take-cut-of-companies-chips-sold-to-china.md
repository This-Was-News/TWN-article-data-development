## Article summary
The U.S. government has struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD to receive 15% of their AI chip sales to China. This agreement, involving President Trump, allows these companies to sell AI chips to China while sharing a portion of their revenue with the U.S. government. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, met with President Trump to finalize this deal, which includes the sale of Nvidia's H20 chip and AMD's MI308 chip. The Commerce Department began granting licenses for these sales shortly after the agreement. This deal is unusual as it involves the government receiving a share of revenue in exchange for export licenses. The Trump administration has been using tariffs and other measures to influence international business deals involving American companies. The deal has sparked controversy among national security experts, who fear it could encourage China to seek similar arrangements for other technologies. Despite the backlash, Nvidia and AMD are expected to generate significant revenue from these sales. The Trump administration has stated that the chips sold to China are less advanced than those sold to U.S. businesses and allies. Nvidia has denied allegations of backdoors in their chips and has opposed congressional efforts to track their chip exports. The deal marks a significant shift in the U.S. approach to AI chip sales to China, with implications for the global race in AI development.
