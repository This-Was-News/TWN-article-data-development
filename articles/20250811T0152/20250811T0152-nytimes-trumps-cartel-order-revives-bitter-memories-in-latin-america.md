## Article summary
President Trump's order to use military force against certain Latin American drug cartels has revived fears of U.S. military interference in the region, reminiscent of the Monroe Doctrine's era. This order has intensified concerns in countries like Mexico and Venezuela, where cartels have been designated as terrorist groups. The move has sparked skepticism and anti-American sentiment across Latin America, drawing from bitter memories of past U.S. military interventions. Critics argue that such interventions have often led to regime change and left power in the hands of corrupt classes aligned with U.S. interests. Historical examples, such as the 1954 U.S.-backed coup in Guatemala, highlight how U.S. interventions have prioritized American interests over democratic principles. The Monroe Doctrine, initially more bark than bite, was later used to justify territorial expansion and military actions, shaping Latin American political identities. President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico has rejected U.S. military involvement, emphasizing national sovereignty. Experts warn that U.S. military action in Mexico could be disastrous for bilateral cooperation on issues like migration and security. The order has also reignited debates about sovereignty and non-intervention, core values for many Latin Americans. Some critics of regimes like Venezuela's have called for U.S. military intervention, while others caution against repeating historical mistakes.
